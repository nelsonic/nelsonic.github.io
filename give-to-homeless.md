## Q: Should we give "Change" to people on the street?

Having seen a rough-sleeper this morning when I went out,
I was wondering about about giving to homeless people...  
My initial instinct is *yes, absolutely*! But it got me curious...


## Research

- Numbers rise to **6,437 people** in **London** in 2012-13, up 13%:

(*detailed* explanation)
- Shelter UK stats: http://england.shelter.org.uk/real_stories/statistics
The stats are *alarming*, but dig deeper and you soon realise
they are picking their numbers carefully for maximum effect.

> Unable to answer the question at this point. Requires more research/time.  
> Every case is unique, *impossible* to make any sort of generalization.

> **Q**: Should orgnaisations like Shelter and BigIssue continue to do their great work?  
> **A**: Absolutely!

My cynicism increased after watching "**Night of the living homeless**"

Yet I still feel compelled to help people who ask...
