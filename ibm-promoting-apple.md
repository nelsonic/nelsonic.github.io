Does anyone else find it at least *interesting* that IBM
sold its PC (hardware) division to [Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo) and is now promoting their
**_direct_ competitors**?

After divesting from the (_low margin_) PC (hardware) game in 2005 IBM went after the "Services business". Then in 2014 the second part of IBM's "no hardware strategy" was enacted when they divested from Servers ...
*Ironically* while IBM's earnings (and market cap/share) continue to decline
Lenovo is doing *splendidly* with growth in most of their sectors.

Interestingly, one of the original companies that became IBM was
[**International _Time Recording_ Company**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company#International_Time_Recording_Company) which *amuses* me
because one of our main projects @dwyl is [**Time**](https://github.com/dwyl/time) ... but I digress.

IBM's Motto (and internal magazine) is called "Think"
