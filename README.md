10kh - Ten Thousand Hours
=========================

this is where I write about things that interest me.


## The 10,000 Hour Rule

If you haven't read Malcolm Gladwell's 2008 book **Outliers**,
I recommend it as a *good* holiday/weekend *read*: 

- http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/
- http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)

The *basic premise* of the book is: 

> the **key** to **success** in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of 
> **practicing** a specific task for a total of around **10,000 hours**.

Over the last 15 years I've accumulated *many* (*thousands* of) hours
in several fields of study/skill but *not tracked* my *progress*
(in a central/systematic way)

I want to *remedy* that and help others do the same.
