10kh - Ten Thousand Hours

### The 10,000 Hour Rule

If you haven't read Malcolm Gladwell's 2008 book Outliers,
its a good holiday/weekend read:
http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/

The basic premise of the book is that the key to success in any field 
is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a 
total of around **10,000 hours**.
