### The 10,000 Hour Rule

If you haven't read Malcolm Gladwell's 2008 book Outliers,
its a good holiday/weekend read:
http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/

The basic premise of the book is: 

> the **key** to **success** in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of 
> **practicing** a specific task for a total of around **10,000 hours**.
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)

Over the last 15 years I've accumulated quite a few (*thousand*) hours
in several fields of study/skill but not tracked my progress.
I want to remedy that and help others do the same.

I don't want to create *another* "blogging platform", 
I want something *way more*!

Publishing information ("content") is the first part ...

### Publishing Platform

I've used *many* publishing platforms and not found one I **love**.
