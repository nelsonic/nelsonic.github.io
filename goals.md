# _Why_?

### > “If you _want_ to live a _happy life_, tie it to a _goal_, _not_ to _people or things_.” ~ Albert Einstein

> Think of a time when  you _wished_
you had _started_ something _sooner_. <br />
> For example:
> + learning a new skill,
> + working on a project with a tight deadline,
> + getting fit/strong
> + saving/investing. <br />

> In _most_ things in life,
> _starting earlier_ leads to "_better_" results, <br />
> and yet _most_ people _procrastinate_
> and _blame_ their lack of progress on low "_motivation_".

> _Most_ (93% of) people don't _realise_
> that setting goals _creates_ the _focus_
> which in turn drives _motivation_.
> Without the _clear_ goal, motivation is virtually non-existent.

_Several_ studies have concluded that
the _single_ most important thing we can do
for our own long-term success in life
is set _personal_ goals.
Only by having goals can we make the _most_ of our lives
and minimise our regrets from wasted time.


Once we have clearly defined goals,
we need an _effortless_ way of _tracking_ if an activity is moving
us **towards** (_or **away** from_) our _specific_ goal(s);
more about that later!

Setting of the most _important_ features of the "dwyl app".
After all, how do you _know_ that you are **_doing_ what you love**...?

I don't know if setting goals should be the _first_ step in the App's
"on-boarding" workflow, that is something we will need to _test_
with the people _using_ the app,
however I do know that it will be _important_ to help people _capture_
their goals.





# What are *My* (_Personal_) Goals?

At the _start_ of 2017 I _shared_ my "**Todo List**":
https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/40 for the year. <br />
While _several_ things have been "**checked off**" on the list,
I have made almost _zero_ progress on a _number_ of them
which makes me sad ...
Rather than "_giving up_" on myself watching cartoons on Netflix,
I'm attempting to ***re-focus*** on my **goals** by making them "***SMART***".

> _**Note**: while there is `some` evidence
that sharing goals in `public` <br />
can lead to **not** achieving them
(see: Derek Sivers TED Talk below), <br />
I feel that if I **don't** make the effort
to **clearly communicate** <br />
my goals with the people in my life
who can **help me** achieve them <br />
(e.g: my [**wonderful wife**](@iteles) and other close relatives
who may be <br />
expecting me to stay up late at "Dinner" or work colleagues <br />
who may expect a reply
to an email after 20:00 at night...) <br />
I am **unlikely** to **succeed**._

# 0. Home: Shelter, Safety & Social (Basic Factors)

Maslow's
["hierarchy of needs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)
lists "Physiological", "Safety"
and "Love/Belonging" ("social belonging")
as the two most ***basic*** _foundational_ "***needs***":

<div align="center">

</div>

> _**Note**: If you are **unfamiliar** with Maslow's work,
> I **highly recommend** you take a quick detour to learn!_
> + Read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs
> + Listen: http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/399796647/maslows-human-needs

For **_many_ people** these **_basic_ needs** are **not met**
which is _outrageous_ in a world with so much wealth!
This is not the place to discuss "_wealth re-distribution_",
however I/we do have an _explicit_ goal of helping
_everyone_ achieve the most basic needs.
see: [github.com/dwyl/**phase-two**](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two)

On more than one occasion I have been both _homeless_ and _unemployed_.
I've had a a _taste_ of how soul-destroying it is
to _not_ have a place to call "_home_"
and _understand_ how not having the "basics"
makes achieving virtually _any_ other goal _impossible_.

_Thankfully_, today I have a home where I am "warm, dry and safe". <br />
I am _blessed_ to have access to fresh/clean water
and (_no shortage_) of food! (_see "Nutrition" section below_)



# 1. Health

"_Health_" is `#1` because ***without health***
***everything*** `else` is either _impossible_
or takes **_much_ more time**!

## 1.1 _Sleep_

> **_SMART_ Goal**: Be asleep by 22:00 each night.

> _**Sleep** is **essential** for achieving **anything** in life! see_:
http://www.npr.org/2015/04/17/399800134/why-do-we-need-sleep

_Tiredness_ inhibits _all_ other progress towards _any_ (_of my_) goals!
I need to get _plenty_ of rest by getting an _early_ night.

When I am tired I often loose sight of my goals
and default to negative behaviour
like eating sugary/processed foods to prop up my energy levels.

> _I'm **generally** a "**worse person**" when I'm tired:
I get impatient, irritable/"snappy" and **far less productive**._

I need to follow these **rules**:
+ "_If I'm feeling tired, **sleep**!_"
+ Avoid Eating to "_boost energy_" >> Drink Water or _Sleep_!!
+ Ensure the bedroom is "_as **dark** as **possible**_"

### What does this mean in _Practical_ Terms?

Clearly _communicate_ my desired/target bed (_fall asleep_)
with all relevant people.

I want to be ***asleep*** by **22:00** each night.
"_Early Night_" needs to become the "_norm_", not the (_delightful_) _exception_!

This is the _only_ sustainable way of waking up at **05:00**
which is when my **morning routine _must_ start**.

> `TODO:` wean myself off listening to the Radio to fall asleep.

### 1.1.1 Evening Routine

+ 20:00 - **Final Pomodoro** of ("_Work_") "Screen Time" for the day:
  + "Brain Dump" any last thoughts on today's work into an issue
  + Create any necessary "Todos"
  + ***Plan exactly*** which task we are going to start the next day with.
+ 20:30 Call Family on Phone/Skype if they are available.
+ 20:50 Shut-down Routine:
  + Close all browser tabs
  + Save any work
  + Git Commit any work (_"[WiP]" on a branch if incomplete_)
  + Always push to GitHub!!
  + Shut-down Computer (_not just "sleep"_) and say "_Shut Down Complete_"

### 1.1.2 Screen Curfew

  + No more screens after **21:00** (_set an alarm!_)
  + Read a book on low (red) light or write in a journal instead.


## 1.2 _Nutrition_

The _second_ most important step in achieving _any_ of my goals,
is to ensure that my body has good "_fuel_".

Rules for Successful Nutrition:

### 1.2.1 Water (_Drink Lots/More of it!_)

(_Aim to_) Drink **1 Litre** of **Water 4 times** each day.
I typically drink "cold-brewed" Green Tea or Lemon Water.

> `TODO:` Insert link to research/advice on recommended amounts
of water people should drink for optimal health.

### 1.2.2 Green Smoothies

2. First "_meal_" of the day should be an ultra-nutritious green smoothie
or soup. see: recipes!
+ **Avoid** all **processed/packaged** foods where I do not know/control
the ingredients (sugar/salt), additives and flavour enhancers. including:
  1. Breakfast cereals (_high in added refined sugar!_)
+ ***Eliminate*** "_Empty Calories_"; no sugary drinks of any kind!
+ Don't _Buy_ Ice-Cream as it has as much [sugar](http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/chocolate-fudge-brownie-ice-cream) as Coca-Cola! (_the cheaper the Ice-Cream the worse the ingredients; logical but worth repeating!_)

### 1.2.3 _Eliminate Refined Sugar_




## 1.3 _Exercise_ (_Every Morning_)

+ Spend at least **5 minutes** per day doing
_strength_ (_body weight_) exercises.
  + 20 sec of exercise (_as many "good reps"_ as possible) followed by 10 seconds of rest. 5 mins = 600 seconds;
  + 00:00 - 00:20 Push-ups
  + 00:20 - 00:30 Rest
  + 00:30 - 00:50 Sit-ups
  + 00:50 - 01:00 Rest
  + 01:00 - 01:20 Plank
  + 01:20 - 01:30 Rest
  + 01:30 - 01:50 Left Leg Abductors
  + 01:50 - 02:00 Rest
  + 02:00 - 02:20 Right Leg Abductors
  + 02:20 - 02:30 Rest
  + 02:30 - 02:50 Squats
  + 02:50 - 03:00 Rest
  + 03:00 - 03:20 Lunges
  + 03:20 - 03:30 Rest
  + 03:30 - 03:50 Push-ups 2
  + 03:50 - 04:00 Rest
  + 04:00 - 04:20 Sit-ups 2
  + 04:20 - 04:30 Rest
  + 04:30 - 05:00 Plank 2

> I will be writing a mini-app that basically
has a count-down tier and plays a sound.

### 1.4 Meditation & Mindfulness

+ Spend at _least_ **5 minutes** per day practicing
(_learning_) ***meditation & mindfulness***.

> `TODO`: learn the essentials of Mediation & Mindfulness.

# 2. Family/Loved Ones

### > "_**No one** ever said on their **deathbed**: 'Gee, I **wish** I had **spent more time alone** with my **computer**'._" ~ [Danielle Berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Bunten_Berry)

I am _guilty_ of pouring **_way_ too much** of my time into my computer,
and not anywhere _near_ as much in my relationships.
_Trust_ me, I would _much_ rather win the lottery,
never have to work again and spend all my time with family!
(_more on that in section 4 below._)

The reason _family_ is _second_ after health

+ Make/Spend more time with family in _person_.
+ Figure out how to track the _quality_ of time spent with family.
+ Take ***more photos*** with family.



# 3. Communication

> "_It's dreadful what **little things lead**
people to **misunderstand** each other._"
~ [Lucy Montgomery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Maud_Montgomery)

> "_The single **biggest problem** in **communication**
> is the **illusion** that it **has taken place**_."
~ [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw)

One of the areas of my life
where I am _especially_ "_underachieving_" is ***communication***.
At _least_ once per ~~day~~ _hour_ I feel _frustrated_ because
I feel someone has _misunderstood_ what I have said or written, <br />
***or*** because _someone_ has not given sufficient instruction/clarity
in a request that they have made.

Poor communication is the _single_ biggest time-waster in
an organisation and the biggest cause of relationship breakdown in families.

+ Avoid all "_arguments_" as they are simply misunderstanding
due to poor communication. Instead _immediately **write down**_
the source of the misunderstanding (_in notebook_) as a topic
that requires clarification then _write_ out your point of view
when you have more time (_and a clear head_!)
+ Share my thoughts on a given topic on a _daily_ basis.
+ Invite others to respond (_comments_) to foster dialog.
+ Call Mom, Dad & Gran regularly. (_see: evening routine above_)

# 4. (_Self_) _Actualisation_




## 4.1 Code

+ **Write code** for one of our projects **_every_ day**.
(_opening an **issue** on GitHub with an idea or link is **not enough**
  to **exercise** my coding "muscles"_)

> The _reason_ coding is _first_ is because I _firmly_ believe
software is the _best_ way way to "_leverage_" my time to
the benefit of most people.

## 4.2 Physical Things

`make` _useful_ things that solve real human problems.

I will be _building_ the following projects in the order they are required:
+ Worlds's most comfortable Bunk Bed
+ Wheelchair accessible Sofa-bed (_with linear actuators_)
+ Ergonomic Sit-Stand Desk ... people who need to work at a desk
(_e.g: because they use a monitor._) or those who realise that using
a "**Laptop**" **on** your _lap_ for prolonged periods, _destroys_ posture!
+ Aquaponic/Aeroponic Food Growing Tower
for fresh greens with ***Zero "Food Miles"***

## 4.3 Plants

+ Study natural sciences
+ Plant food-bearing Plant
+ Learn which are the best "_companion plants_" for each food plant.
+ Track as many variables as feasible.

# 5. Income & Expenditure

1. Make "_enough_" money to cover all living expenses.
2. Track all expenses to ensure that I know where the money is _going_.
3. Determine how much _cash_ I need to invest in my **projects** (_see: section 4, above_)

the value of / reason for setting goals.

While I **_wholeheartedly_ agree** with Eric Thomas' "_gotta want it bad_"
speech and I've _been_ there not sacrificing sleep for (_short term_) success,
I think it's worth noting that he doesn't say you "_must not sleep_",
rather he's saying you must be "***willing to give up sleep***",
i.e. you must be ***willing*** to ***get up*** in the morning,
even when you still feel tired and want to "_snooze_".
I suspect that on stage when he's delivering a "_motivational speech_",
he doesn't really have that much time to go into the
"_benefits of a **sustainable routine**_" ... he's just trying to illustrate
to people that those who are successful
wanted what they got more than _anything_ else.
If _you_ want to be successful _long-term_, i.e. without "_burn out_",
_trust, me_ you ***need sleep***. But you _must_ "_sleep smart_".
Learn how to improve the _quality_ of your sleep so you wake up refreshed
and _ready_ for another day of _focus_.

#### Keep Your Goals to Yourself (Derek Sivers): https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4

[![keep your goals to yoursef](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30483747-e88eed34-9a1f-11e7-9618-8e7b132d8fa9.png)](https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4)

Derek Sivers shares the good *theory* "***Social Reality***"
which states that if you *communicate* your goals with others,
your mind lets *you believe* they have _already_ been  _achieved_
and therefore you are less likely to make the effort
required to *actually* achieve it.

Even though there is _some_ scientific _evidence_ to support the theory,
I ***don't agree*** with this ***at all***.
If you don't *share* your goals with anyone  
a) Nobody will *understand* ***why*** (or *what*)
you are trying to achieve/change/improve  
b) You will have **no help/support** to keep you "on
track" towards your goal.  
c) You will **not** find ***like-minded people*** to *accelerate* your goals!

Think about the
[***WeightWatchers***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_Watchers)
or
[**Grameen Bank**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank)
model of group-accountability:
in both the weight loss and micro-loans *everyone* in the group
knows each other's fitness and financial goals, respectively,
and both are highly successful (and *widely copied*) models.

Another perfect/plentiful example of people sharing their goals
is Kickstarter where people share their idea/goal -
*complete strangers* fund them - and the whole thing works
precisely _because_ people *follow through* with their announced
goals/plans (i.e. *deliver* what they promise).

You fail to achieve your goal, because you don't ["***want it bad***"](http://youtu.be/mgmVOuLgFB0?t=2m14s)

> Also, I _know_ I'm not meant to "_criticize_" people for their appearance,
but I find it _difficult_ to trust someone talking about achieving goals
who is overweight ...
_**nobody** has "**belly fat**" on their list of **goals**_!"

#### To Achieve Your Goals, Don't Focus on Them (Reggie Rivers): https://youtu.be/V2PP3p4_4R8

![dont focus on your goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30485975-047d69ba-9a27-11e7-91d0-4795697121e0.png)

This is an _interesting_ video where Reggie Rivers re-iterates the point
made earlier by Brian Tracy: don't focus on your goals.
The _downside_ of the video is that Rivers does not give any
practical instruction on "_how to set goals_" in the _first_ place.
