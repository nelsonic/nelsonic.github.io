We need an _effortless_ way of _tracking_ if an activity is moving
us **towards** (_or **away** from_) our _specific_ goal(s).

I feel like this will be one of the most _important_ features of the "dwyl app".
After all, how do you _know_ that you are **_doing_ what you love**...?

I don't know if setting goals should be the _first_ step in the App's 
"on-boarding" workflow, that is something we will need to _test_
with the people _using_ the app, 
however I do know that it will be _important_ to help people _capture_
their goals.

"_Constantly think: If I had **no limitations**, **what goals** would I set for myself?_"

![imagine no limitations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30491828-7ebf68ae-9a36-11e7-9f30-44b21cf65d03.png)

If your life was _perfect_ in the "four key areas" of life:
Income, Family, Health & Net Worth ... 

"_The **fear** of **not achieving** your goal, what we call self-limiting beliefs, **holds you back more than anything else**._" 

![income goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30492392-334c3e7c-9a38-11e7-90c9-67e854c759cf.png)

Create a "_five year fantasy_".
What is the _first_ step you have to take right now to achieve this goal?

![family goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30492659-246f45e2-9a39-11e7-9d7f-635386c067c1.png)

"_What would have to happen **today** for me to create that **perfect future** and what would be the **first step**_?"

"_The most important responsibility you have 
is **setting** goals in the first place. <br />
Goal **achieving** seems to be **automatic**,
it's the goal **setting** you are responsible for._"


> Aside: At the end of the video Brian Tracy gives a selling master-class:
https://youtu.be/mRRkMOTzpXg?t=35m23s 
> + Price Build Up: 
> "_Live event attendees have paid $1997 for a single person to attend..._"
https://youtu.be/mRRkMOTzpXg?t=36m44s
> Creating time-pressure: 
"_and the best part is: for a limited time you get both ... 
for the price of one_" ...
 "_but this offer won't be available for long
 so you have 3 options: 
 one: you can **do nothing** and continue treading water, 
 frustrated and not moving forward 
 and not achieving your goals as fast as you want <br />
 number two: you can try to figure it out on your own,
 with no proven system or strategy to guide you
 which is the **primary reason** why people underachieve and **fail**
 or **number three**: you can put my **30 years** of research knowledge and 
 experience to use by implementing my **proven model** 
 for achievement and success
 saving you thousands of dollars and **countless hours** of **frustration**.
 The choice is yours.
 Stop treading water and take action now; order my course ... **today**_"


#### Keep your goals to yourself (Derek Sivers): https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4

[![keep your goals to yoursef](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30483747-e88eed34-9a1f-11e7-9618-8e7b132d8fa9.png)](https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4)

Derek Sivers shares the good *theory* "***Social Reality***"
which states that if you *communicate* your goals with others,
your mind lets *you believe* they have _already_ been  _achieved_
and therefore you are less likely to make the effort
required to *actually* achieve it.

Even though there is _some_ scientific _evidence_ to support the theory,
I ***don't agree*** with this ***at all***.
If you don't *share* your goals with anyone  
a) Nobody will *understand* ***why*** (or *what*)
you are trying to achieve/change/improve  
b) You will have **no help/support** to keep you "on
track" towards your goal.  
c) You will **not** find ***like-minded people*** to *accelerate* your goals!

Think about the
[***WeightWatchers***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_Watchers)
or
[**Grameen Bank**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank)
model of group-accountability:
in both the weight loss and micro-loans *everyone* in the group
knows each other's fitness and financial goals, respectively,
and both are highly successful (and *widely copied*) models.

Another perfect/plentiful example of people sharing their goals
is Kickstarter where people share their idea/goal -
*complete strangers* fund them - and the whole thing works
precisely _because_ people *follow through* with their announced
goals/plans (i.e. *deliver* what they promise).

You fail to achieve your goal, because you don't ["***want it bad***"](http://youtu.be/mgmVOuLgFB0?t=2m14s)

> Also, I _know_ I'm not meant to "_criticize_" people for their appearance,
but I find it _difficult_ to trust someone talking about achieving goals
who is overweight ... 
_**nobody** has "**belly fat**" on their list of **goals**_!"


#### To Achieve Your Goals, Don't Focus on Them (Reggie Rivers): https://youtu.be/V2PP3p4_4R8

![dont focus on your goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30485975-047d69ba-9a27-11e7-91d0-4795697121e0.png)

This is an _interesting_ video where Reggie Rivers re-iterates the point 
made earlier by Brian Tracy: don't focus on your goals.
The _downside_ of the video is that Rivers does not give any
practical instruction on "_how to set goals_" in the _first_ place.

## What are *My* (_Personal_) Goals?

1. Get/Be Healthy (without physical fitness everything else takes longer!)
2. Track time > https://github.com/nelsonic/time
