## > “If you _want_ to live a _happy life_, tie it to a _goal_, _not_ to _people or things_.” ~ Albert Einstein

## > “_The ultimate reason for setting goals is to entice you to become the person it takes to achieve them_” ~ Jim Rohn


The _single_




We need an _effortless_ way of _tracking_ if an activity is moving
us **towards** (_or **away** from_) our _specific_ goal(s).

I feel like this will be one of the most _important_ features of the "dwyl app".
After all, how do you _know_ that you are **_doing_ what you love**...?

I don't know if setting goals should be the _first_ step in the App's
"on-boarding" workflow, that is something we will need to _test_
with the people _using_ the app,
however I do know that it will be _important_ to help people _capture_
their goals.

that you wished you had started something sooner.

"_Constantly think: If I had **no limitations**, **what goals** would I set for myself?_"

If your life was _perfect_ in the "four key areas" of life:
Income, Family, Health & Net Worth ...

"_The **fear** of **not achieving** your goal, what we call self-limiting beliefs, **holds you back more than anything else**._"

"_The most important responsibility you have
is **setting** goals in the first place. <br />
Goal **achieving** seems to be **automatic**,
it's the goal **setting** you are responsible for._"

 "_but this offer won't be available for long
 so you have 3 options:

 frustrated and not moving forward
 and not achieving your goals as fast as you want <br />
 number two: you can try to figure it out on your own,
 with no proven system or strategy to guide you
 which is the **primary reason** why people underachieve and **fail**
 or **number three**: you can put my **30 years** of research knowledge and
 experience to use by implementing my **proven model**
 for achievement and success
 saving you thousands of dollars and **countless hours** of **frustration**.
 The choice is yours.
 Stop treading water and take action now; order my course ... **today**_"


#### Keep Your Goals to Yourself (Derek Sivers): https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4

[![keep your goals to yoursef](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30483747-e88eed34-9a1f-11e7-9618-8e7b132d8fa9.png)](https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4)

Derek Sivers shares the good *theory* "***Social Reality***"
which states that if you *communicate* your goals with others,
your mind lets *you believe* they have _already_ been  _achieved_
and therefore you are less likely to make the effort
required to *actually* achieve it.

Even though there is _some_ scientific _evidence_ to support the theory,
I ***don't agree*** with this ***at all***.
If you don't *share* your goals with anyone  
a) Nobody will *understand* ***why*** (or *what*)
you are trying to achieve/change/improve  
b) You will have **no help/support** to keep you "on
track" towards your goal.  
c) You will **not** find ***like-minded people*** to *accelerate* your goals!

Think about the
[***WeightWatchers***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_Watchers)
or
[**Grameen Bank**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank)
model of group-accountability:
in both the weight loss and micro-loans *everyone* in the group
knows each other's fitness and financial goals, respectively,
and both are highly successful (and *widely copied*) models.

Another perfect/plentiful example of people sharing their goals
is Kickstarter where people share their idea/goal -
*complete strangers* fund them - and the whole thing works
precisely _because_ people *follow through* with their announced
goals/plans (i.e. *deliver* what they promise).

You fail to achieve your goal, because you don't ["***want it bad***"](http://youtu.be/mgmVOuLgFB0?t=2m14s)

![disused gym equipment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30485471-666d0b8c-9a25-11e7-8785-686af5166904.png)

> Also, I _know_ I'm not meant to "_criticize_" people for their appearance,
but I find it _difficult_ to trust someone talking about achieving goals
who is overweight ...
_**nobody** has "**belly fat**" on their list of **goals**_!"

#### To Achieve Your Goals, Don't Focus on Them (Reggie Rivers): https://youtu.be/V2PP3p4_4R8

![dont focus on your goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30485975-047d69ba-9a27-11e7-91d0-4795697121e0.png)

This is an _interesting_ video where Reggie Rivers re-iterates the point
made earlier by Brian Tracy: don't focus on your goals.
The _downside_ of the video is that Rivers does not give any
practical instruction on "_how to set goals_" in the _first_ place.



# What are *My* (_Personal_) Goals?

At the _start_ of 2017 I _shared_ my "**Todo List**":
https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/40 for the year.
While _several_ things have been "**checked off**" on the list,
I have made almost _zero_ on a _number_ of them which makes me sad ...
Rather than "_giving up_" on myself watching cartoons on Netflix,
I'm attempting to ***re-focus*** on my **goals** by making them "***SMART***".

> _**Note**: there is `some` evidence that sharing goals in `public`
can lead to **not** achieving them (see: Derek Sivers TED Talk below),
I feel that if I **don't** make the effort to **clearly communicate**
my goals with the people in my life who can **help me** achieve them
(e.g: my [**wonderful wife**](@iteles) and other close relatives
who may be expecting me to stay up late at "Dinner" or
work colleagues who may expect a reply to an email after 20:00 at night...)
I am **going** to fail._


# 1. Health

"_Health_" is _first_ because without health
everything else is either impossible or takes much more time!

## 1.1 _Sleep_

> **_SMART_ Goal**: Be asleep by 22:00 each night.

Tiredness inhibits _all_ other progress towards _any_ (_of my_) goal!
I need to get _plenty_ of rest by getting an _early_ night.

When I am tired I often loose sight of my goals
and default to negative behaviour
like eating sugary/processed foods to prop up my energy levels.

> _I'm **generally** a "**worse person**" when I'm tired:
I get impatient, irritable/"snappy" and **far less productive**._

I need to follow these **rules**:
+ "_If I'm feeling tired, **sleep**!_"
+ Avoid Eating to "_boost energy_" >> Drink Water or _Sleep_!!

### What does this mean in _Practical_ Terms?

Clearly _communicate_ my desired/target bed (_fall asleep_)
with all relevant people.

I want to be ***asleep*** by **22:00** each night.
"_Early Night_" needs to become the "_norm_", not the (_delightful_) _exception_!

This is the _only_ sustainable way of waking up at **05:00**
which is when my **morning routine _must_ start**.

> `TODO:` wean myself off listening to the Radio to fall asleep.

### 1.1.1 Evening Routine

+ 20:00 - **Final Pomodoro** of ("_Work_") "Screen Time" for the day:
  + "Brain Dump" any last thoughts on today's work into an issue
  + Create any necessary "Todos"
  + ***Plan exactly*** which task we are going to start the next day with.
+ 20:30 Call Family on Phone/Skype if they are available.
+ 20:50 Shut-down Routine (_)

## 1.2 _Nutrition_

The _second_ most important step in achieving _any_ of my goals,
is to ensure that my body has good "_fuel_".

Rules for Successful Nutrition:

### 1.2.1 Water (_Drink Lots/More of it!_)

(_Aim to_) Drink **1 Litre** of **Water 4 times** each day.
I typically drink "cold-brewed" Green Tea or Lemon Water.

> `TODO:` Insert link to research/advice on recommended amounts
of water people should drink for optimal health.

### 1.2.2 Green Smoothies

2. First "_meal_" of the day should be an ultra-nutritious green smoothie
or soup. see: recipes!
+ **Avoid** all **processed/packaged** foods where I do not know/control
the ingredients (sugar/salt), additives and flavour enhancers. including:
  1. Breakfast cereals (_high in added refined sugar!_)
+ ***Eliminate*** "_Empty Calories_"; no sugary drinks of any kind!
+ Don't _Buy_ Ice-Cream as it has as much [sugar](http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/chocolate-fudge-brownie-ice-cream) as Coca-Cola! (_the cheaper the Ice-Cream the worse the ingredients; logical but worth repeating!_)

## 1.3 _Exercise_ (_Every Morning_)

+ Spend at least **5 minutes** per day doing
_strength_ (_body weight_) exercises.
  + 20 sec of exercise (_as many "good reps"_ as possible) followed by 10 seconds of rest. 5 mins = 600 seconds;
  + 00:00 - 00:20 Push-ups
  + 00:20 - 00:30 Rest
  + 00:30 - 00:50 Sit-ups
  + 00:50 - 01:00 Rest
  + 01:00 - 01:20 Plank
  + 01:20 - 01:30 Rest
  + 01:30 - 01:50 Left Leg Abductors
  + 01:50 - 02:00 Rest
  + 02:00 - 02:20 Right Leg Abductors
  + 02:20 - 02:30 Rest
  + 02:30 - 02:50 Squats
  + 02:50 - 03:00 Rest
  + 03:00 - 03:20 Lunges
  + 03:20 - 03:30 Rest
  + 03:30 - 03:50 Push-ups 2
  + 03:50 - 04:00 Rest
  + 04:00 - 04:20 Situps 2
  + 04:20 - 04:30 Rest
  + 04:30 - 05:00 Plank 2

> I will be writing a mini-app that basically
has a count-down tier and plays a sound.

### 1.4 Meditation & Mindfulness

+ Spend at _least_ **5 minutes** per day practicing
(_learning_) ***meditation & mindfulness***.

### 1.5 Screen Curfew

+ No more screens after **21:00** (_set an alarm!_)



# 2. Family/Loved Ones

+ Spend more time with family in _person_.
+ Figure out how to track the _quality_ of time spent with family.
+ Take more photos with family.

# 3. Communication

+ Avoid all "_arguments_" as they are simply misunderstanding
due to poor communication. Instead _immediately **write down**_
the source of the misunderstanding (_in notebook_) as a topic
that requires clarification then _write_ out your point of view
when you have more time (_and a clear head_!)
+ Share my thoughts on a given topic on a daily basis.
+ Invite others to respond (_comments_) to foster dialog.
+ Call Mom, Dad & Gran regularly. (_see: evening routine above_)

# 4. (_Self_) _Actualisation_

## 4.1 Code

+ **Write code** for one of our projects **_every_ day**.
(_opening an **issue** on GitHub with an idea or link is **not enough**
  to **exercise** my coding "muscles"_)

> The _reason_ coding is _first_ is because I _firmly_ believe
software is the _best_ way way to "_leverage_" my time to
the benefit of most people.

## 4.2 Physical Things

`make` _useful_ things that solve real human problems.

I will be _building_ the following projects in the order they are required:
+ Worlds's most comfortable Bunk Bed
+ Wheelchair accessible Sofa-bed (_with linear actuators_)
+ Ergonomic Sit-Stand Desk ... people who need to work at a desk
(_e.g: because they use a monitor._) or those who realise that using
a "**Laptop**" **on** your _lap_ for prolonged periods, _destroys_ posture!
+ Aquaponic/Aeroponic Food Growing Tower
for fresh greens with ***Zero "Food Miles"***

## 4.3 Plants

+ Study natural sciences
+ Plant food-bearing Plant
+ Learn which are the best "_companion plants_" for each food plant.
+ Track as many variables as feasible.

# 5. Income & Expenditure

1. Make _enough_ money to cover all living expenses.
2. Track all expenses to ensure that I know where the money is _going_.
3. Determine how much _cash_ I need to invest in my **projects** (_see: section 4, above_)
