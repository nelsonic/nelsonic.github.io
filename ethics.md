# Work Ethics

Who we work for says more about us as a person that virtually *anything* else!
By working for a given organisation we are explicitly endorsing all the
activities of that organisation whether we chose to admit it or not!




## Who Should we Work for?

Is the freedom to chose who we "*sell*" our time to a luxury?
Most people (98% < ?)

> (1) *Everyone has the right to work, to* ***free choice of employment***,  
> *to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment*.  
> [Article 23 of the **UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS**](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a23)


## Who Would You *NOT* Work For?

Do you have a list of the types of organisations you would *not* work for?
If you don't already have this list, why not?  
e.g: *Would* you work for a Tobacco Company...?

### My List

The *industries* I would not work for (*in decending order*)

#### 1. Weapons Manufacture/Supply

We *all know* that "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" ... and yet,
bad people (read: Gangs, Criminals,
  [Military Dictators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship))
  all *use* weapons for their evil ends which are not limited to killing
  but include many other heinous crimes.
