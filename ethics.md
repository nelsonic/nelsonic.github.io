# Work Ethics

Who we work for says more about us as a person that virtually *anything* else!
By working for a given organisation we are explicitly endorsing all the
activities of that organisation whether we chose to admit it or not!




## Who Should we Work for?

Is the freedom to chose who we "*sell*" our time to a luxury?
Most people (98% < ?)

> (1) *Everyone has the right to work, to* ***free choice of employment***,  
> *to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment*.  
> [Article 23 of the **UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS**](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a23)


## Who Would You *NOT* Work For?

Do you have a list of the types of organisations you would *not* work for?
If you don't already have this list, why not?  
e.g: *Would* you work for a Tobacco Company...?

## My List

The *industries* I would not work for (*in decending order*)

### 1. Weapons Manufacture/Supply

We *all know* that "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" ... and yet,
bad people (e.g: Gangs, Criminals,
  [Military Dictators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship))
  all *use* weapons for their evil ends which are not limited to killing
  but include many other heinous crimes.

### 2. Addictive (Harmful) Substances

I would not work for any group of people (be they a "legitimate" company or criminal gang) involved in the supply of harmful addictive substances (*both legal or illegal*).

#### Examples of Harmful Addictive Subtances:

+ ***Alcohol*** - Alcoholism is the *reality* left out of the
snazzy advertising. While the CDC definition leaves *most*
people out of the list of "alcoholics or alcohol dependent",
you would be surprised how many people are categorised as
being a
"[*heavy drinker*](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm)". It's not my place to "*judge*" anyone for what they
*choose* to consume, but I don't want to be a *part* of the
machine that systematically markets a harmful product
to young people when the (*negative*) health and wellbeing effects are ***widely known***:
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_effects_of_alcohol_consumption
  + http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Alcohol-misuse/Pages/Introduction.aspx
+ ***Tobacco*** - Anyone who still claims that smoking is good
is *undeniably* being paid by one of the Tobacco commpanies/lobbies.
> **Fact**: Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. This is about one in five deaths. http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tobacco-companies-still-target-youth/
+ ***Sugar*** - possibly the worst of all?


The debate on legalising (*certain*) drugs deserves its own post.
I'm in favor of legalising and regulating the Supply of
***naturally occurring*** plants such as cannabis and (Psilocybin) mushroom because by out-lawing them people
who *want* to use these *plants* end up funding dealers.
If they were legalised, an entire section of the criminal
world would be forced to re-consider their activities.

### 3. Addictive (Harmful) Activities

> Gambling

### 4. Video Games?
