# Work Ethics

Who we work for says more about us as a person that virtually *anything* else!
By working for a given organisation we are explicitly endorsing all the
activities of that organisation whether we chose to admit it or not!




## Who Should we Work for?

Is the freedom to chose who we "*sell*" our time to a luxury?

> (1) *Everyone has the right to work, to* ***free choice of employment***,  
> *to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment*.  
> [Article 23 of the **UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS**](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a23)


## Who Would You *NOT* Work For?

If you don't already have this list, why not?
e.g: Would you work for a Tobacco Company?
