## tl;dr

Your time is _finite_ so here's the ***summary***:

+ _Most_ Meetings (_are a_) _waste_ (_of_) _time_.
+ Meeting with specific people to discuss a well-defined agenda _can_
be fruitful provided _everyone_ is well informed/prepared
and the order of the agenda is by value/priority to the team/company.
+ **People** who schedule meetings without adequate preparation
(_with the **excuse** that discussions happen best in-person_)
**are (being) _lazy_**.
+ **Ideas** can ***easily*** be **discussed** _asynchronously_ and _should_ be
captured in a **system** to avoid losing them;
our chosen system is **GitHub**<sup>1</sup>.
+ All **Decisions** (_can and_) **should** be **made** in a **system**
to ensure ***transparency*** and ***accountability***;
our chosen system is **GitHub**<sup>1</sup>.
+ When a "_sensitive_" decision needs to be made in private,
we should


## _Deciding_ to _Not_ Waste Time in _Unfocussed_ Meetings

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/26192801/f1774668-3baa-11e7-866c-c4f83d03d6e8.png)


The *issue* opened by Mark _claims_ that "_it was decided last week_".<br />

To be ***100% clear*** I made the _decision_ to _not_ ***waste time***
in ***unfocussed meetings*** a _very_ long time ago.
The _only_ reason I still attend meetings is because most clients expect it.
More than half of the time spent in meetings is _wasted_.

the only _decision_ that was made in that meeting,
was by me (_Nelson_): to not tolerate people wasting my time. <br />
The decision to _shedule_ fruitless meetings was made a _long_ time ago; it's not _recent_.
Perhaps we should have done a _better_ job of _capturing_ the ideal decision making process
`before` Mark joined, but _sadly_, that was not done.
But we can _remedy_ it and make it _clear_
for _all_ current and _future_ people.

## Meeting for the _Sake_ of Meeting

Meeting simply because we have a meeting _scheduled_ is like going
to the shops without a shopping list; _guaranteed to be **unfocussed**_.
Sure, _most_ people go to the shops without a list,
these are called "_average_" people and the retailers _love_ them!

## Ideal Decision-Making Process

+ [ ] Open an issue with the idea/challenge
+ [ ] Write as much as you know in the description so you capture it from the outset.
+ [ ] If applicable set a _deadline_ for the decision. this is as simple as writing:
> DEADLINE: 20170805 16:00
(_we **will** be writing a parser to read "metadata" from issues in )
+ [ ] Does the decision require market _research_? e.g: a buying decision.
  + [ ] Do the research and summarise the available options.
+ [ ] Request input from _specific_ people who have knowledge in the area or will assist in making the decision. (_preferably get their feedback on the issue, not verbally as this ensures accountability_)
+ [ ] If nobody responds to your request for feedback, and the decision is "_material_" or "_urgent_", consider drawing their attention to the issue the next time you speak to them verbally or via SMS.
(_though if people are ignoring their GitHub notifications without a **valid** work deadline, that should be addressed..._)
+ [ ] Once people have replied ensure that a _clear_ decision is recorded in the issue.

## Meetings are an _Interruption_

Meetings _interrupt_ the state of ["_flow_"](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) of the people who are (_or were_) getting work done.

"_Things don't get done at work because of Managers and Meetings (M&Ms)_" https://youtu.be/5XD2kNopsUs?t=8m38s
"M&Ms" are _one_ of the biggest reasons I don't work for _another_ company.
Meeting just for the sake of meeting are what _average people_ in _mediocre_ companies do because they are _avoiding_ getting work done; i.e. they _waste_ time.
Do we _want_ to be "_average_" or do we want to be "_outliers_"?

If a meeting is scheduled for an hour it will take 5-10 mins for the attendees to _re-locate_ to the meeting venue, an hour for the meeting and then another 10-20 mins to get back into "work mode" after the meeting; a total of **1.5h** out of the day.

Very few companies _make_ money out of meetings (_unless they are a group "meeting facilitaors"_)
Our _product_ (_or service_) is building software. Unless the meeting helps us build _better_ software, it pretty much a _waste of time_. It's quite _simple_ when you think about it; what is our _output_ as a company; what is it that we _sell_? It it _meeting minutes_ or code/software?

## Cost of Time

> The time of each person in the company should be _valued_ by [**Opportunity Cost**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).
> The value of a "_senior_" member of our team (_10+ years experience_) is **£600/day**.
> (_if anyone **chooses** to value their time at less, that's their choice, not mine!
> I value my time **higher** than what we charge our clients because I know that if I **invest** my time wisely it will be worth **considerably** more in the future. also I've worked at an Agency were my time was charged out at £1500/day so what we charge our non-FTSE100 clients is kinda low! but this is a **whole** other discussion!_)
> Assuming there are **7 working hours** in the day this equates to **£85/hour**.
>
> If there are

> Each time we hold a **1 hour meeting** (_actually 1.5h of 3 people's time_)
> it **costs** the company (_at least_) ***£300***. (_assuming
> Note: I _value_ my time _higher_ than what we charge our clients,
because I _value_ my _future_ earning from _wisely **investing** my time **now**_.
If I had _valued_ my time at _less_ than what we are charging the client,
I would have _no_ incentive to learn any new skills
and would instead work all the hours of the day on client projects.
If others chose _not_ to place a value on their time, that's their choice, but don't waste _other_ people's time just because you don't _value_ your own.
> Unless the _outcome_ of the meeting is worth more than this cost, we are **_wasting_ money**.
> How _many_ of the meetings we've had this year have had a £300+ outcome? (_either a permanent cost saving or an increase in recurring revenue_?)

Meetings should _only_ be called when something _specific_ needs to be discussed/decided that _cannot_ be discussed/decided _asynchronously_ and in `public` on GitHub.
We should meet for a _precise_ reason.
That is _not_ to say we shouldn't call meetings when _necessary_.
Meetings _should_ be called when required, but the person calling the meeting should _factor_ the _cost/benefit_ of the meeting in terms of the total time for all participants (_including **disruption** to the **work** the people trying to get done_) and the meeting should _only_ be called if the benefit outweighs the cost. (_seems pretty obvious, but it's surprising how often people ignore the value of each other's time_!)

So far the _weekly_ meetings have had a _very_ low return on time investment.
If we've had 10 x 1h meetings, can anyone summarise the decisions/outcomes that have _made_ us £3000 in income or _saved_ us £3000 in cost?

Decisions can _easily_ be made in a _systematic_ way on GitHub.
We just have to _want_ to be _disciplined_ about this.
I _agree_ that tracking tasks in GitHub in Milestones is not "_perfect_" but it's _way_ better than a Google Doc. Most importantly, keeping _everything_ on GitHub that _can_ be on GitHub means people don't have go to various places to find information.

The _questions_ we should _always_ ask is:
+ "_Will this **process scale** when there are **1k people** in the **company**?_"
+ "_Is this **remote first**_?"
+ "_Are we **accurately recording decisions** in a **version controlled** system_?"

## Lack of _Clear_ Agenda with _Valuable_ Items

I _like_ the idea of having a daily "standup",
and I think it _only_ has to take 30 seconds per person. <br />
Here's an example:

> Yesterday {pair_programmer_name} and I <br />
> worked on issue {yesterday_issue_number} <br />
> which is feature {yesterday_issue_title} <br />
> We _briefly_ got stuck on {challenging_thing}
> But I asked a question on GitHub/StackOverflow
> And {colleague_name} was able to help us, so we got it done!
> I Documented everything in the issue so anyone can learn from our work.
> The original estimate for the task/story was {original_estimate}
> and it took {actual_time_taken} because of {reasons_for_overtime}
> Today I'm working on issue ... for feature ...
> I don't expect to have any blockers
> but will update the issue if I do.

## Do you _Love_ Meetings?

I _don't_ love meetings, they _always_ feel like a waste of time
because _someone_ is _always_ underprepared, wastes time or
 I love getting my work done.
I love people, I don't love prescribed amounts of time to meet with those people.

## <sup>1</sup>Why GitHub?

The _reason_ we use GitHub for our _code_
is because it's the (_by far_) the _most popular_ platform for hosting code.
GitHub is where the _vast majority_ of programmers host their (Open Source) code
and interact with the community.
Given that our _product_ is _software_ and that software get's _made_,
reviewed and managed on GitHub it follows that we should attempt to keep
