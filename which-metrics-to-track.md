Who should have *access* to the key metrics?

- Zabbix - Infrastructure monitoring: Ask infrastructure team.
- Kibanna - Application Logs (Full Stack): http://kibana.production.thomascook.io/
- Google Analytics - Front End Application Logs: https://www.google.com/analytics
- New Relic - Node.js Application Performance Monitoring (APM): https://login.newrelic.com
- JMeter - Full Stack Load Testing: Ask Amit/Pascal for results.
- Jenkins - Build Metrics: https://jenkins.thomascook.io

Kibana is already publicly available on the internal TC network.
Can we have a generic read-only account which can be used to display
metrics from New Relic and Google Analytics to *everyone*?
