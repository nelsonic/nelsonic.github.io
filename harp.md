## How?

### Installation

![why sudo install?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/master/img/harp-encourages-sudo-install.png)

I was *immediately* ***put off by*** the fact that Harp.js encourages people
to install their module using ***sudo***!

Thankfully, the install *does* work *without sudo*.

```sh
npm install harp -g
```

(The module creators/maintainers have probably just included the
sudo to avoid getting more "*unable to install...*" issues)
