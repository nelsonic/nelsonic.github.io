# Which Templating Library Should I Use?

The question of "which templating library" has come up several times
during the course of my work and play. I've used a few libraries.
Some I found frustrating (Jade!) while others (EJS) gave too much
scope to shoot one's self in the foot (logic in the views!)

**Conclusion**: Handlebars  
*Why*? Because it has nicer/**better documentation**.
(syntax virtually identical to Mustache)
