html or markdown ?
==================

Intro
-----

**Q**: Should I ***learn markdown***? <br />
**A**: (short) Yes.
       (long) markdown can simplify your life many instances.
       its essential for writing readme (documentation) on GitHub
       and can be used in several commenting systems and blogging engines.

**Q**: Isnt **html** is the *language* of the web...? <br />
**A**: Yes. html is still the language used to display web pages
	   and is likely to be for the foreseabl future. 
	   The beauty is markdown simplifies writing for the web
	   while allowing you to easily convert to html.

### html

*H*yperText *M*arkup *L*anguage is the main markup language 
for creating web pages and other information that can be 
displayed in a web browser.

example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
		<p>This is a pragraph with a 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">link</a>
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```



### markdown

Markdown is a plain text format/syntax designed so that it can 
*optionally* be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. 
Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing 
messages in online discussion forums, or in text editors for the 
quick creation of rich text documents.

example (will produce equivalent html to above):

```markdown
This is a Heading
=================

This is a paragraph with a 
[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)
```

### Comparison

As you can see from these two simple snippets the **Markdown** version is
**simple** and <br />
(once you understand the syntax) faster to read and write.
