# html or markdown ?

## Intro

**Q**: Should I learn markup when html is the language of the web...?
**A**: (short) Yes.
       (long) markdown can simplify your life many instances.
       its essential for writing readme (documentation) on GitHub
       and can be used in several commenting systems and blogging engines.

### html

*H*yperText *M*arkup *L*anguage is the main markup language 
for creating web pages and other information that can be 
displayed in a web browser.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
		<p>This is a pragraph with a 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">link</a>
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```



### markdown

Markdown is a plain text format/syntax designed so that it can 
*optionally* be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. 
Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing 
messages in online discussion forums, or in text editors for the 
quick creation of rich text documents.

```markdown
# This is a Heading

This is a paragraph with a 
[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)

```

### Comparison

As you can see from these two simple snippets the **Markdown** version is
**simple** and (once you understand the syntax) faster to read and write.
