## Family

- **20131231** Spent another day DIYing (building furniture and installing lights) in
my Mom's appartment. 3 more days in Portugal. Then back to code.

- **20131230** Sketched out one of the diagrams for patent application today. ;-)
Need to write a post on my thoughts on patents, trolls and innovation... #todo

- **20131229** Sick as a dog the past few days. :-(
Didn't even think of Code... This has not been a very productive "holiday"...

- **20131226** Its not called "**Boxing Day**" in Portugal. 
But there's a sale at almost every shop starting today.
So heading to Ikea with mom to buy some furniture for the flat...
Also getting internet installed in the flat today 
so might be able to code tonight... fingers crossed.

- **20131225** Chrismas day. Sick from eating *all* the *wrong* things.
and the punishment has not ceased. 
Next year I want to be in a Muslim country over Christmas to avoid toxifying my body.


- **20131224** Christmas Eve. Seems like a good day to spend with family.

- **20131223** Today I Spent the whole day helping my parents move house.
Not the *best* use of my time, but good to help out.

- **20121222** For the next few days I'm in **Portugal** with family.
