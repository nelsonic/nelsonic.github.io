## Family


- **20131225** Chrismas day. Sick from eating *all* the *wrong* things.
and the punishment has not ceased. 
Next year I want to be in a Muslim country over Christmas to avoid toxifying my body.


- **20131224** Christmas Eve. Seems like a good day to spend with family.

- **20131223** Today I Spent the whole day helping my parents move house.
Not the *best* use of my time, but good to help out.

- **20121222** For the next few days I'm in **Portugal** with family.
