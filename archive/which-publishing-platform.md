# Publishing Platform

## Why is Testing Important?

I've used *many* publishing platforms and not found one I **love**.
*Undeniably* the **most popular** publishing (blogging) platfomr is 
Wordpress.com. 14% of the Top 1 Million (most visited) websites are
running on Wordpress! http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WordPress

When we consider **PHP** as *whole*, it still accounts for 39% of the top 1M!

## List of *Gripes* with Existing Platforms

- Steep learning curve (e.g. Drupal!)
- Security Bugs *Galore*!
- **Installation** (even with a "*one-click-script*"" is still installation!)
- Lack of Unit/Regression Testing (new "features" *break* old ones!)
- Regular Upgrade/Patching required
- Tedious Package Management systems with poor version control.
- **No** (Built-in) **Backup** (3rd Party Modules aren't great...)
