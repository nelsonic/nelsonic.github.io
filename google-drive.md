# Saving Data to Google Drive

**Q**: Do I _worry_ that Google might be "_sharing my secrets_" with another
organisation?  
**A**: No. First, I don't _have_ any secrets ... and second
Google already knows _everything_ about me. (Location, friends,
  interests, etc.), and I'm not worried about using their service
  to store some of my data.

maybe you **shouldn't be doing it** in the first place._"

But, I **100% acknowledge** that there are people who do _not_ want to share
_everything_ with Google, and

I use google every day for searching because they have the best service.
We also save *all* our documents to Drive because it's the easiest way
to share and co-author documents.

But what about using Drive to store our "_Raw_" Data?
