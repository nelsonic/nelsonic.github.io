# _How_ To Discover Your "_Life Purpose_" by Process of Elimination

![snoopy-meaning-of-life](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36786692-3b844d4a-1c7f-11e8-8b1a-ba3fe7a1f049.png)


## Pemise 

_Discovering_ your "***life purpose***" will help you lead a more **_meaningful_ life** 
which in turn will help you be "_happier_" and _healthier_, 
increasing both the _length_ and _quality_ of your life.

This premise is robustly defended in a recent "New Scientist" article:
"A meaning to life: How a sense of purpose can keep you healthy":
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331100-500-a-meaning-to-life-how-a-sense-of-purpose-can-keep-you-healthy
Which in turn summarises/references peer-reviewed academic studies.

Therefore the _focus_ of this post is, as it's title suggests, to _discover_ that "life purpose"
(_not to "convince" you/anyone that it's a "good idea" to have a "life purpose"_).


## Definitions 

_Before_ we dive in, let's take a moment to _clarify_ a few definitions:

+ **Life**: the state of being alive, specifically while your life has 
  ["quality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life) (_i.e. not in a "coma"_)
+ **Purpose**: the **reason** for which something is done or created or **for which something exists**. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life
+ **Process of _Elimination_**: a **process** of **deleting options** whereby 
  the **remaining options** have the higest chance of being **correct**. 
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_of_elimination 
  Note: this is not a "full proof" 

## Axioms

+ **Life** is ***finite***. Even if you believe in an 
  ["afterlife"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife) or 
  ["reincarnation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation), 
  your _current_ life is _finite_; some day you will die.
+ There is only **one** "version" of **you** in _this_ space and time. 
  For the purpose of this discussion, the 
  [**multiverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) is not considered
  to avoid giving yourself the _excuse_ that "the **other you**" is using their life effectively, 
  so you don't have to! Feel free to discuss "parallel universes" in your own "spare time".
+ A **decision** to spend your time on a particular activity 
  means ***forgoing*** an **_alternative_ activity** for that "_block_" of time.
