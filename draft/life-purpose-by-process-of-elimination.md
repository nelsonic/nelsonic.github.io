# _How_ To Discover Your "_Life Purpose_" by Process of Elimination

![snoopy-meaning-of-life](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36786692-3b844d4a-1c7f-11e8-8b1a-ba3fe7a1f049.png)

## Premise

_Discovering_ your "***life purpose***" will help you lead a more **_meaningful_ life**
which in turn will help you be "_happier_" and _healthier_,
increasing both the _length_ and _quality_ of your life.

This premise is robustly defended in a recent "New Scientist" article:
"A meaning to life: How a sense of purpose can keep you healthy":
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331100-500-a-meaning-to-life-how-a-sense-of-purpose-can-keep-you-healthy

This popular article 
in turn summarises/references 
peer-reviewed academic studies.

Therefore the _focus_ of this post is, 
as it's title suggests, 
to _discover_ that "life purpose"
(_not to "convince" you/anyone 
that it's a "good idea" to have a "life purpose"_).


## Definitions

_Before_ we dive in, let's take a moment to _clarify_ a few definitions:

+ **Life**: the state of being alive, specifically while your life has
  ["quality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life) (_i.e. not in a "coma"_)
+ **Purpose**: the **reason** for which something is done or created or **for which something exists**.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life
+ **Process of _Elimination_**: a **process** of **deleting options** whereby
  the **remaining options** have the higest chance of being **correct**.
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_of_elimination
+ **Proactive** behavior involves acting 
  in advance of a future situation, 
  rather than just _reacting_.
  It means taking control and 
  making things happen rather than just adjusting
  to a situation or waiting for something to happen.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactivity
  > **Note**: this is ***not*** the same as being
  [***preoccupied***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preoccupied)
  which is allowing your attention 
  to be prematurely occupied
  by an _uncertain_ future event 
  _without_ taking any _action_ 
  to reduce its' impact.
  E.g: _worrying_ about getting ill 
  but not _systematically_ reducing 
  the risk of illness 
  by altering one's nutritional intake 
  and exercise protocol.

## Axioms

+ **Life** is ***finite***. Even if you believe in an
  ["afterlife"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife) or
  ["reincarnation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation),
  your _current_ life is 
  [_finite_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/finite#Adjective); 
  some day you will die.
+ There is only **one** "version" of **you** 
  in _this_ space and time. <br />
  > For the purpose of this discussion, the
  [**multiverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) 
  is not considered
  to avoid giving yourself the _excuse_ that "the **_other_ you**" 
  is using their life effectively,
  so you don't have to! 
  Feel free to discuss "parallel universes"
  and the 
  ["Many-worlds interpretation)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation)
  in your own spare time.
+ A **decision** to spend your time on a particular activity
  means ***forgoing*** an **_alternative_ activity** for that "_block_" of time. <br />
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
+ [***Indecision***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indecision#Noun)
  is _still_ a (_form of_) _decision_;
  you are _deciding_ to _defer_ the decision
  and consequently trying to _avoid_ thinking about it.


## Assumptions

+ The reader _wants_ to use their life/time effectively. <br />
(_if you have not made the **decision** 
to take control of your life, don't read this._)


## Caveats

![house-md-blame-it-on-the-boogie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36846983-b1ae527e-1d54-11e8-8478-a6bf462f1ff6.png)

This method of _eliminating_ 
from a range of available options
will not result in "_100% certainty_", 
instead it is a good _approximation_
that will help people who are "stuck".
This is _similar_ to a medical
["***diagnosis of exclusion***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_of_exclusion)
which does _not_ give "complete confidence",
but "rules out" _most_ other diagnosis
so the "patient" does not have to "worry"
about the diseases/conditions they do _not_ have.

For _some_ people their "life purpose" is _obvious_
and they just _get on_ with it,
while for _others_ it's _inconceivable_
and they are "_stuck_" and often "_give up_"
on searching for / finding theirs.

...

If you don't _already_ know me,
I'm a fan of [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism),
for breaking things down into _simpler_ parts wherever _possible_.

That means for _example_, if you are considering your own life,
you _can_ break it down into:
+ past (_you cannot change_)
+ present (_mostly within your control_)
+ future (_something to look forward to but, depends on others. i.e. has "uncertainty"_)
