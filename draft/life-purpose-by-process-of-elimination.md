# _How_ To Discover Your "_Life Purpose_" by Process of Elimination

![snoopy-meaning-of-life](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36786692-3b844d4a-1c7f-11e8-8b1a-ba3fe7a1f049.png)


## Pemise 

_Discovering_ your "***life purpose***" will help you lead a more **_meaningful_ life** 
which in turn will help you be "_happier_" and _healthier_, 
increasing both the _length_ and _quality_ of your life.

This premise is robustly defended in a recent "New Scientist" article:
"A meaning to life: How a sense of purpose can keep you healthy":
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331100-500-a-meaning-to-life-how-a-sense-of-purpose-can-keep-you-healthy
Which in turn summarises/references peer-reviewed academic studies.

Therefore the _focus_ of this post is, as it's title suggests, to _discover_ that "life purpose"
(_not to "convince" you/anyone that it's a "good idea" to have a "life purpose"_).


## Definitions 

_Before_ we dive in, let's take a moment to _clarify_ a few definitions:

+ **Life**: the state of being alive, specifically while your life has 
  ["quality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life) (_i.e. not in a "coma"_)
+ **Purpose**: the **reason** for which something is done or created or **for which something exists**. 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life
+ **Process of _Elimination_**: a **process** of **deleting options** whereby 
  the **remaining options** have the higest chance of being **correct**. 
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_of_elimination 
+ **Proactive** behavior involves acting in advance of a future situation, rather than just _reacting_.
  It means taking control and making things happen rather than just adjusting 
  to a situation or waiting for something to happen.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactivity
  **Note**: this is ***not*** the same as being 
  [***preoccupied***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preoccupied)
  which is allowing your attention to be prematurely occupied 
  by an _uncertain_ future event _without_ taking any _action_ to reduce it's impact. 
  E.g: _worrying_ about getting ill but not _systematically_ reducing the risk
  of illness by altering one's nutritional intake.

## Axioms

![spoiler-alert-everybody-dies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36802005-72d19f9c-1cab-11e8-806a-8e5a804c8bb5.jpg)

+ **Life** is ***finite***. Even if you believe in an 
  ["afterlife"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife) or 
  ["reincarnation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation), 
  your _current_ life is _finite_; some day you will die.
+ There is only **one** "version" of **you** in _this_ space and time. 
  For the purpose of this discussion, the 
  [**multiverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) is not considered
  to avoid giving yourself the _excuse_ that "the **other you**" is using their life effectively, 
  so you don't have to! Feel free to discuss "parallel universes" 
  and "many worlds" in your own "spare time".
+ A **decision** to spend your time on a particular activity 
  means ***forgoing*** an **_alternative_ activity** for that "_block_" of time. 
  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost
+ **Indecision** is _still_ a (_form of_) _decision_; you are simply _deferring_ being _proactive_.


## Assumptions

+ The reader _wants_ to use their life/time effectively. <br />
(_if you have not made the **decision** to take control of your life, don't read this._)


## Caveats

![house-md-blame-it-on-the-boogie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36846983-b1ae527e-1d54-11e8-8478-a6bf462f1ff6.png)

This method of _eliminating_ from a range of available options
will not result in "_100% certainty_", instead it is a good _approximation_
that will help people who are "stuck".
This is _similar_ to a medical 
["***diagnosis of exclusion***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_of_exclusion)
which does _not_ give "complete confidence", 
but "rules out" _most_ other diagnosis
so the "patient" does not have to "worry" 
about the diseases/conditions they do _not_ have.




## Intro

For _some_ people their "life purpose" is _obvious_ 
and they just _get on_ with it, 
while for _others_ it's _inconceivable_ 
and they are "_stuck_" and often "_give up_" 
on searching for / finding theirs.

If you don't _already_ know me, 
I am a [reductionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism).
I like to "break things down" into _simpler_ parts wherever _possible_.

That means for _example_, if you are considering your own life, 
you _can_ break it down into:
+ past (_you cannot change_)
+ present (_mostly within your control_)
+ future (_something to look forward to but, depends on others. i.e. has "uncertainty"_)
