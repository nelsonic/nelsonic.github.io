## Family

- **20150227** InÃªs and I spent the day in Edinburgh today.
We rather selfishly went to lunch, Hillend and Bowling by ourselves
(because we haven't had much time for "*just us*" lately...)
It was a good day together. But sadly not much code. :-(

- **20140223** Went to visit [dscape](https://github.com/dscape) and family.
He's working *way* too hard on [YLD](http://www.yld.io/) but its going to Yield nicely... ;-)
Only PeerSun code. Need to convince them to open source the project I'm working on...

- **20140112** today was my parents' 37th wedding anniversary. no celebration. simple lunch.
I spent the afternoon teaching my mom wordpress... I *really* dislike wordpress. :-(

- **20140111** Spent another day helping my mom set up her new flat
and *finally* got her to focus on setting up the domain + website for her idea: http://after4.org/
only a basic wordpress site right now, but will be an after-school activities website.
Brain frazled so not writing any code for my project today. :-( sleep well world. ;-)

- **20140104** Today was dismantling the last few bits of furniture at the old flat and traveling back to london.
tomorrow I will be back on teh codez! :-)

- **20140103** Another un-productive day code-wise... spent it setting up the shelving/storage units
in the garage so my dad has a place to store his ***ocean*** of books.

- **20140102** Today I made a point of taking everyone out of the house to get away from Moving!
So we went to do Off-road SegWay in Sintra! pic.twitter.com/tFILY79d6a

- **20131231** Spent another day DIYing (building furniture and installing lights) in
my Mom's appartment. 3 more days in Portugal. Then back to code.

- **20131230** Sketched out one of the diagrams for patent application today. ;-)
Need to write a post on my thoughts on patents, trolls and innovation... #todo

- **20131229** Sick as a dog the past few days. :-(
Didn't even think of Code... This has not been a very productive "holiday"...

- **20131226** Its not called "**Boxing Day**" in Portugal.
But there's a sale at almost every shop starting today.
So heading to Ikea with mom to buy some furniture for the flat...
Also getting internet installed in the flat today
so might be able to code tonight... fingers crossed.

- **20131225** Chrismas day. Sick from eating *all* the *wrong* things.
and the punishment has not ceased.
Next year I want to be in a Muslim country over Christmas to avoid toxifying my body.


- **20131224** Christmas Eve. Seems like a good day to spend with family.
