# tilr

During my time at Pearson I've got to work on a couple of projects.
The most interesting one ~~is~~ *was* **tilr**:

## Case Study

Unboxed case study:
http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/case-studies/pearson-tilr  
(My name is not listed in the case study because I was *not an* Unboxed *Employee*.  
... contractors get paid in ***cash, not credit*** ...
But my signature hoodie, glasses and note-taking is clearly visible
in the case study photo...)

## Thoughts

### Why I Took the Contract

While I *don't agree* with *many* things Pearson has done in the past as a
company (see below), I do ***love*** their ***motto*** ("***Always Learning***")  
and I was *excited* to be working on a project that could help kids learn
(and track their learning).

### Team

The team I got to work with was superb and I remain good friends with all of them!
+ **Owen White**: has gone on to found **EdTech Futures**: http://edtechfutures.com/
+ [**Tony Daly**](https://twitter.com/tonydaly): is working his *magic* [@LostMyNameBook](https://twitter.com/lostmynamebook): http://making.lostmy.name/
+ [**Richard Knights**](https://twitter.com/dknights) is UX lead at [**Wipro**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/1318) see:
http://richardknights.brandyourself.com/
+ [**Bill James**](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=323540955) our
phenomenal ***Product Owner*** is working as an independent consultant teaching
other education-focussed organizations how to be **Lean**.
+ Most of the Unboxed team are *still* at Unboxed:
http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people
(its a *great* place to work - if you're a Rails dev!)

### Outcome?

We launched the app with two schools and saw *SnapChat* levels of engagement!
Kids loved it! We had deliberately borrowed ideas from Twitter (encourage concise posts with character count-down), Instagram (photo sharing),
Facebook (mentioning/tagging friends) and WhatsApp (chat/comments)
and the feedback we got from kids (*and their teachers!*) was universally positive.

> "*Its the **Instagram for schools***"

Yet, despite the traction, Pearson was going through a(nother) "*Re-Organisation*"
and CEO [**John Fallon**](https://twitter.com/johnfallon) did not see the value
in investing in a light-weight mobile-first social network for schools...
I cannot fault his "*logic*" as it did not have a clear route to profitability.

Sadly we failed to convince the ***Legal People*** that
open-sourcing the project would be a good idea so there is no (*public*) GitHub
page I can point to...

If I get another chance to work on an Education-focussed product/service
I will *only* accept if its *OpenSource* from day one.
