The HackerNews discussion thread is _way_ more interesting/insightful than the WSJ article/video.

The WSJ article **does** explain how Fb buys "offline" shopping data
and correlates it back to your account,
but it ***does not*** _address_ the scenario
where something _totally unrelated_ to your past _online_ search history
is _mentioned_ in a ***verbal*** (_supposedly "offline"_) conversation
and then suddenly appears as an Ad on Fb.
It's not a "_coincidence_" or a "_prediction_" based on a algorithm ...

> I _saw_ this happen the other day at my Sister's house.
She _mentioned_ a place in a _verbal_ conversation.
a few minutes (_less than 30mins_) later an Ad appeared on Fb on her phone for that place.
Nobody in the room had ever been to the place
and she _assured_ us that she had not searched for it online.
I have a hard time believing it was a "**coincidence**" ...

> _**Not** that she is going to **decrease** her FB/WhatsApp/Instagram-**addiction** ..._ ðŸ™„

"Reply All" episode #109 had quite a **_few_ examples**
(_some of which were "explained away", though not convincingly, but a couple which were damning..._)

The **Wired** article from last year written by https://twitter.com/antoniogm
(_a Former FB employee who, while often **critical** of FB, is still invested in the company and does not want to see it **tank** but who has **no idea** what is in the code for the Fb app since he left  ...!_)
had a similarly _dismissive_ conclusion:

## _"Privacy is No Longer The Norm"_

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/6966628/Facebooks-Mark-Zuckerberg-says-privacy-is-no-longer-a-social-norm.html

_Everyone_ at Fb has a _vested interest_ in "***harvesting***" as _much_ data as possible on their ["MAUs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monthly_active_users)
because increasing the data they have on people translates to more targeted adds (and clicks on those adds) which increases revenue/profit (the value of the company) making them _all_ richer.

> _What is **more likely**:
> a company whose "**lifeblood**" is **harvesting** your **personal data**
> is **not listening** to your conversations (after you "**granted access**"
> to your microphone when you installed the app... )_
> _**OR** they are **actively** recording and "sending home" your conversations
> so they can _target_ you with Ads and then [**lying**](https://qz.com/1004070/facebook-fb-built-an-ai-system-that-learned-to-lie-to-get-what-it-wants) about it...?_

## "Entitlement"?

Would Apple give Uber Entitlement ("privileged") access to iPhone APIs and _not_ Fb...?

Once you have granted access to an App it can snap/listen any time it wants:

## Why is the Fb App So _Big_?

***Why*** is the Facebook app so big ***244Mb***?

### What does the App `Do` that it _Needs_ to be this Big?

+ News Feed: code to display "cards" with photos, videos, links to external content & Ads

+ all the tracking code to monitor your location for better Ad targeting ...
+ What `else` ? (_I ask because I don't **have**/**use** the app so don't know what it does anymore_!)

Are the multi-device "assets" _really that_ big, is their code that _inefficient_?
Or is it doing _something_ `else` besides showing you fake news,
making you [depressed](https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel) and [tracking everything everywhere](https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/all-the-ways-facebook-tracks-you-that-you-might-not-kno-1795604150)?

> _What if they **justify** using the microphone for app "**diagnostic**" and **performance** related data_?
> _After all, Fb **need** to **collect Voice Data** `so that` they can make their future [**Voice Recognition**](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/19/voice-recognition-technology-nsa/)
and "content translation" products **better**, right..._?
