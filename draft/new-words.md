“***If you want something new,
you have to stop doing something old***.”<br />
~ Peter Drucker

# How do we introduce new ideas?

How do you ***learn new things***?
Can you learn things *without* learning ***new words***?
Should people ***recycle old words*** to give them
***new meaning***?

## Why ?

### Do we need new ideas?

How do we introduce people to new concepts
(and their associated words)

## Who *doesn't* like learning New Words?

I've always *loved* learning new words.
In school I used to try and *squeeze* new words
into my english essays to ~~demonstrate~~ show I
knew what they meant.

Words like *Onomatopoeia*, *Kaleidoscope*
or *Retrospective*. (more on that last one later...)

If you never went through the phase of showing off
your vocabulary, bare with me for 60 seconds.

## Background

### A 5-Minute intro to Consultant Vocabulary

If your *lucky* enough to work somewhere small enough
to never have experienced "the consultants" coming in
to tell you how to do your job.

People who use the word "**bandwidth**" instead of *time*
or say we need to stop "**Boiling the ocean**"
to mean doing something "too difficult". <br />

We need to do a "**Headcount Synergy**".

Lets go to town with: <br />

"**Going forward**" we need to
"**Reach Out**" to the
"**Stakeholders**" and do more
"**Blue Sky Thinking**" to come up with some
"**Quick Wins**" only after we've ticked off the
"**Low Hanging Fruit**" can we move onto the
"**Game-changing**" ideas.
