## What is *Continuous Delivery* (CD) and (why) should we use it?

**Continuous Delivery** (CD) is a practice used to ***automate***
and improve the process of software delivery.  
Techniques such as automated testing, continuous integration and
continuous deployment allow software to be developed to a
high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test environments,
resulting in the ability to rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out
enhancements and bug fixes to customers at low risk and with *minimal*
***manual*** overhead.
