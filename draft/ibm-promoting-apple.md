Does anyone else find it at least *interesting* that IBM
sold its PC (hardware) division to [Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo) and is now promoting their
**_direct_ competitors**?

After divesting from the (_low margin_) PC (hardware) game in 2005 IBM focussed all their attention on "Services". Then in 2014 *Phase 2* of IBM's "***no hardware strategy***" was enacted when they divested from Servers ...
*Ironically* while IBM's earnings (and market cap/share) continue to decline
Lenovo is doing *splendidly* with growth in most of their sectors.

## Historical IBM vs. Apple Rivalry

In the 80's & 90's IBM made *every* effort to *kill* Apple in the war for the PC.

Steve Jobs was so anti IBM that he commissioned the 1984 "Big Brother" Commercial

Evolution of IBM Logo

Interestingly, one of the original companies that became IBM was
[**International _Time Recording_ Company**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company#International_Time_Recording_Company) which *amuses* me
because one of our main projects @dwyl is [**Time**](https://github.com/dwyl/time) ... but I digress.

IBM's Motto (and internal magazine) is called "Think"

Apple (Steve) encouraged people to "***Think Different***":

(discontinued in 2002) shortly after the iPod was launched https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod
