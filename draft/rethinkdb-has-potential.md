# RethinkDB

RethinkDB appeared on my radar today.
Its by no means new (the project has been around since 2009!)
It ticks all the right boxes for scalability, performance and simplicity
(simple query sintax).

## Official Description

An open-source distributed database built with love.

Enjoy an intuitive query language, automatically parallelized queries, and simple administration.

Table joins and batteries included.
