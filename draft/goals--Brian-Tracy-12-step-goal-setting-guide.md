# Brian Tracy's 12 Step Goal-Setting Guide


## 1. `Decide` _exactly_ what you want in every _key area_ of _your life_.

1. ***Income*** – how much do you want to earn this year, next year and five years from today?
2. ***Family*** – what kind of a lifestyle do you want to create for yourself and your family?
3. ***Health*** – how would your health be different if it was perfect in every way?
4. ***Net Worth*** – how much do you want to save and accumulate in the course of your
working lifetime?


### The "Quick List" ("Three Goal") Method

> _In **less** than **30 seconds**, write down your **three most important goals** in life, right **now**_.

**30 seconds** is **_enough_ time** to extract the goals that reflect what you _really_ want in life.


## 2. `Write` it down.
### Your goals must be clear, specific, detailed and _measurable_.

You _must_ write out your goals as if you were placing an order in a factory at a great distance. Make your description clear and detailed in every sense.

> "_Only **3%** of **adults** have **written goals**, and **everyone else works for them**._"


## 3. Set a `Deadline`.
#### _Your subconscious mind uses deadlines as “forcing systems” to drive you , consciously and unconsciously toward achieving your goal on schedule._

1. If your goal is big enough, set sub-deadlines.
2. If you want to achieve financial independence, you may set a 10 or 20-year goal, and
then break it down, year by year, so that you know how much you have to save and
invest each year.
3. If for some reason you don’t achieve your goal by the deadline, simply set a new
deadline. There are no unreasonable goals, only unreasonable deadlines.


## 4. Identify the `Obstacles` that you will have to overcome to achieve your goal.

Why aren’t you already at your goal? Only 20% of the reasons you are
not achieving your goal are on the outside.
Always start with yourself.

> _The **Theory of Constraints** states there is always
**one limiting factor** or constraint that sets the speed
at which you achieve your goal. What is it for you?_


## 5. Identify the `Knowledge`, information and `Skills` you will need to achieve your goal.

1. Especially, identify the skills that you will have to develop to be in the top 10% of
your field.
2. Your ***weakest key skill*** sets the height of your income and your success.
i. Key Question: “What one skill, if you developed and did it in an excellent
fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on your life?” Whatever the
skill, write it down, make a plan and work on it every single day.

> _**Key Question**: “What **one skill**, if you developed and did it in an excellent fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on your life?_”


## 6. Identify the `People` whose help and cooperation you will require to achieve your goal.

**Make a _list_** of every person in your life that you will have to work with or work around to
achieve your goal.
1. Start with the members of your **family**, whose cooperation and support you will
require.
2. List your **boss** and **coworkers**.
3. Especially, identify the **customers** whose support you will need to sell
enough of your product or service to make the kind of money that you want.
4. Once you have identified the key people whose help you will require, ask yourself
this question, “What’s in it for them?”
5. To achieve big goals you will have to have the help and support of lots of people.
6. The most successful people are those who build and maintain the largest networks of
other people whom they can help and who can help them in return.


## 7. Make a `List` of Everything you will have to `do` to achieve your goal.

1. List **every single step** that you can think of that you will have to follow
to achieve your goal.
2. As you think of new items, add them to your list until your list is complete.
3. When you make out a list of all the things you will need to do to achieve your goal,
you begin to see that this goal is far more attainable than you thought.



## 8. Organize your List into a `Plan`.

1. Organize the list by arranging the steps by **sequence** and ***priority***.
  1. Sequence – what do you have to do `before` you do something else,
  and in what order?
  2. Priority – what is more important and what is less important?
  The 80/20 Rule says that 80% of your results
  will come from 20% of your activities.
2. The 20/80 Rule says that the first 20% of time
that you spend planning your goal and organizing your plan
will be worth 80% of the time and effort required to achieve the goal.
Planning is very important.

> "_If you **fail** to **plan**,
you are **planning** to **fail**!_" ~ Benjamin Franklin

## 9. Make a `Plan`.

Making a `Plan` is the _highest_ "_return-on-investment_" (ROI)
thing you can do with your time (_by far_)! <br />
When you have a Goal and a Plan, you increase the
likelihood of achieving your goals by 10 times, by 1000%! <br />
**Each minute** spent in **planning**
**saves _10 minutes_** in **_execution_**.

1. _Organize_ your list into a **series of steps** from the beginning
to the completion of your goal.
  1. **Plan** each day, week and month **in _advance_**.
  2. Plan each **month** at the ***beginning*** of the month.
  3. Plan each **week** the ***weekend before***.
  4. Plan each **day** the ***evening before***.
2. The more careful and detailed you are when you plan your activities,
the more you will accomplish in less time.


## 10. Select your `Number One`, _Most Important Task_ for `Each Day`

1. Set priorities on your list using the 80/20 Rule.
Ask yourself this question:
“_If I could **only do one thing** on this **list**,
which **one activity** is **most important**?_”
Whatever you answer to that question, put a number “1” next to that activity.
2. Then, ask yourself, “If I could only do one other task on this list, which one task would
be the most valuable use of my time?” Then write a number “2” next to that task.
3. Go on until you have seven topics.
4. Focus and Concentration are the keys to success.
  1. Focus means that you know exactly what it is that you want to accomplish.
  2. Concentration requires that you dedicate yourself to doing only those things
that move you toward your goal.


## 11. Develop the `Habit` of `Self-discipline`

1. Once you have decided on your most important task,
resolve to **concentrate _single mindedly_**
on that one task until it is **100% complete**.
2. Your ability to select your most important task and then to work on it single
mindedly, without diversion or distraction, will double and triple the quality and
quantity of your output and your productivity.
2. Single Handling is one of the most powerful of all time management techniques.

> "_**avoid** all **distractions** and stay with that task
**until** it is **done**_"

## 12. `Visualize` Your Goals

1. Create clear, **vivid, exciting, emotional pictures** of **your goals**
as if they were already a reality. Imagine yourself enjoying
the accomplishment of this goal.
2. In visualizing, take a few moments to ***create the emotions***
that would accompany the successful achievement of your goal.
3. A mental picture combined with an emotion has an enormous impact on your
subconscious and your superconscious mind.
  1. This ***activates*** your **superconscious** mind.
  2. Your superconscious mind activates the Law of Attraction and begins
attracting into your life **people**, circumstances, ideas
and **resources** that will help you to achieve your goals even faster.


## 13. Goal-Setting _Exercise_

On a clean sheet of paper (_or fresh page in your notebook_),
write the word “Goals” at the top of the page along with today’s date.

Discipline yourself to write out **at _least_ 10 goals** that you would like
to accomplish in the next year, or in the foreseeable future.

Begin each goal with the word “I.” Only you can use the word “I.” Follow the word “I” with an action verb that acts as a command from your conscious mind to your subconscious mind.
Describe your goals in the present tense, as though they had already been achieved. If your goal is to earn a certain amount of money in a certain year, you would say, “I earn this number of dollars by the end of this year.”
If your goal is to get a new car, you would say, “I drive such and such a new car by such and such a date.”
Finally, when you write down your goals, always write them in the positive tense. Instead of saying, “I will quit smoking,” you would say, “I am a non-smoker.”
