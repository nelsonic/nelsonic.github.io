  h1 Template inheritance

  p.
    Jade supports template inheritance via the #[code block] and #[code extends] keywords. A block is simply a "block"
    of Jade that may be replaced within a child template, this process is recursive.

  p.
    Jade blocks can provide default content if desired, however optional as shown below by #[code block scripts], #[code block content], and #[code block foot].

  p layout.jade
  +jade
    :jadesrc
      html
        head
          title My Site - \#{title}
          block scripts
            script(src='/jquery.js')
        body
          block content
          block foot
            #footer
              p some footer content

  p Now to extend the layout, simply create a new file and use the #[code extends] directive as shown below, giving the path (with or without the .jade extension). You may now define one or more blocks that will override the parent block content, note that here the #[code foot] block is #[em not] redefined and will output "some footer content".

  p page-a.jade
  +jade
    :jadesrc
      extends ./layout.jade

      block scripts
        script(src='/jquery.js')
        script(src='/pets.js')

      block content
        h1= title
        each pet in pets
          include pet

  p.
    It's also possible to override a block to provide additional blocks, as shown in the following example where #[code content] now exposes a #[code sidebar] and #[code primary] block for overriding, or the child template could override #[code content] all together.

  p sub-layout.jade
  +jade
    :jadesrc
      extends ./layout.jade

      block content
        .sidebar
          block sidebar
            p nothing
        .primary
          block primary
            p nothing
  p page-b.jade
  +jade
    :jadesrc
      extends ./sub-layout.jade

      block content
        .sidebar
          block sidebar
            p nothing
        .primary
          block primary
            p nothing


  h2 Block append / prepend

  p Jade allows you to #[em replace] (default), #[em prepend], or #[em append] blocks. Suppose for example you have default scripts in a "head" block that you wish to utilize on #[em every] page, you might do this:

  +jade
    :jadesrc
      html
        head
          block head
            script(src='/vendor/jquery.js')
            script(src='/vendor/caustic.js')
        body
          block content

  p Now suppose you have a page of your application for a JavaScript game, you want some game related scripts as well as these defaults, you can simply #[code append] the block:

  +jade
    :jadesrc
      extends layout

      block append head
        script(src='/vendor/three.js')
        script(src='/game.js')

  p When using #[code block append] or #[code block prepend] the #[code block] is optional:

  +jade
    :jadesrc
      extends layout

      append head
        script(src='/vendor/three.js')
        script(src='/game.js')
