# Does *Everyone* fit a Personality (Stereo) Type?

Yesterday I attended a **full-day** of training on "**[Insights Discovery](https://www.insights.com/564/insights-discovery.html)**".

The idea is to "*discover*" our
[**personality type**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type)
to help us
*communicate* better with others who may be of a different type.

I learned about the personality types
at university in 2003, then at **Southwestern Co.** "***Sales School***" in Nasville (also 2003) and
during my first week induction at **Deloitte**
in 2008.  
When in 2013 I was asked to take a
**Myers-Briggs** Questionnaire at **Groupon** by the *incomming* HR "Director" I *knew*
I had become a *number* (no longer a person);
if the person in "***HR***" does not have the
*time* to have a *conversation* with you - having to
resort to an off-the-shelf questionnaire to
"get to know you" - you know *for **sure*** you are
working in the *wrong* place!

## An Alternative Approach (*Listen*!)

I propose an alternative: sit down with the person
you want to find out about. (Preferably take them out to lunch - let the person pick the food/place!)
and ask a few *open* questions to find out *exactly*
what makes them *tick*. e.g:

### If they are *New* to the Team/Org

+ *Why* did you decide to join . . . Team/Org?
+ You were at  . . . *why* did you leave?

### Existing Team Members

+ You have been here  . . . Years/Months, what have
been the best/worst parts?
+ If you could change one thing about Team/Org what
would it be any why?

### Common Questions

+ How did you get into this work?
+ How long have you been doing . . . ?
+ What do you do in your spare time? / What do you do for fun?
+ Where do you feel most relaxed?
+ What is your favourite kind of *music*?
+ What is your ideal holiday? (surprisingly revealing)
+ What would you do if you won the *Lottery*?
