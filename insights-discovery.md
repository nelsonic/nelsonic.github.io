Yesterday I attended a full-day of training on "**[Insights Discovery](https://www.insights.com/564/insights-discovery.html)**".

The idea is to "*discover*" our
[**personality type**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type)
to help us
*communicate* better with others who may be of a different type.
