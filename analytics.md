# Analytics

## Why?

The (startup) project we are currently working on relies
heavily on [segment.io](https://segment.io) for tracking
usage.  
While the privacy policy does *clearly* state that we are
collecting usage data, I'm still uncomfortable with
sending it to a 3rd Party... I don't like the idea of *anyone*
having data on how I use something even "*anonymised*".

So it got me thinking, **how hard** would it be to do this
*without* sending any data to a 3rd party? #**HowHardCanItBe** :wink:



## What?

> *"**Analytics** is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data*."
