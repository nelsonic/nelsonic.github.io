# Analytics

## Why?

The (startup) project we are currently working on relies
heavily on [segment.io](https://segment.io) for tracking
usage.  
While the privacy policy does *clearly* state that we are
collecting usage data, I'm still uncomfortable with
sending it to a 3rd Party... I don't like the idea of *anyone*
having data on how I use something even "*anonymised*".

I've read (and *highly* recommend) the following books on Analytics:
+ **Web Analytics**: An **Hour a Day** (by [***Avinash Kaushik***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avinash_Kaushik)):
http://www.amazon.com/Web-Analytics-Hour-Avinash-Kaushik/dp/0470130652
+ **Web Analytics 2.0**: The Art of Online Accountability and Science of Customer Centricity:
http://www.amazon.com/Web-Analytics-2-0-Accountability-Centricity/dp/0470529393
+ **Advanced Web Metrics** with Google Analytics:
http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Web-Metrics-Google-Analytics/dp/1118168445
+ **Lean Analytics**: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster:
http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Analytics-Better-Startup-OReilly/dp/1449335675

(let me know if you want to *borrow* the *paper* copies)

So it got me thinking, **how hard** would it be to do this
*without* sending any data to a 3rd party? #**HowHardCanItBe** :wink:


## What?

> *"**Analytics** is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data*."

If you are completely new to this, read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics

Google Analytics (GA) is (*by far*) the most popular website stats/tracking platform.
But there are quite a few competitors coming up.

## Open Source Alternatives

+ **Piwik** (by far the most popular): http://piwik.org/what-is-piwik/
We've used Piwik in the past, the reason we're not considering it now,
is because its made with PHP... https://github.com/piwik/piwik and we want ***real-time*** usage.
+ Open Web Analytics (**OWA**):
http://www.openwebanalytics.com/?page_id=2
+ eAnalytics: http://eanalytics.de/product/eanalytics-web-analytics.html
(never used it. looks ok. but can't find the source without registering...)
+ Parsely.com: https://parsely.com/tour/ + https://github.com/Parsely

# Can we do it *better*?

At the moment this is just a *thought* experiment,
because I/we don't have *time* to build our own analytics/tracking platform.  
But, if I had time to spare, its one of the things I would *love* to try!
