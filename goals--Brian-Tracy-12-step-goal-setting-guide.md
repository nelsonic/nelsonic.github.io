# 12 Step Goal-Setting Guide – Brian Tracy



## 1. Decide exactly what you want in every key area of your life.

a. 1. Income – how much do you want to earn this year, next year and five years from
today?
b. 2. Family – what kind of a lifestyle do you want to create for yourself and your family?
c. 3. Health – how would your health be different if it was perfect in every way?
d. 4. Net Worth – how much do you want to save and accumulate in the course of your
working lifetime?
Hint: Three Goal Method – in less than 30 seconds, write down your three most important
goals in life, right now.

## 2. Write it down. Your goals must be clear, specific, detailed and measurable. 

You must writeout your goals as if you were placing an order in a factory at a great distance. 
Make your
description clear and detailed in every sense.

## 3. Set a deadline. Your subconscious mind uses deadlines as “forcing systems” to drive you.
a. If your goal is big enough, set sub-deadlines.
b. If you want to achieve financial independence, you may set a 10 or 20-year goal, and
then break it down, year by year, so that you know how much you have to save and
invest each year.
c. If for some reason you don’t achieve your goal by the deadline, simply set a new
deadline. There are no unreasonable goals, only unreasonable deadlines.

## 4. Identify the obstacles that you will have to overcome to achieve your goal. 

Why aren’t you already at your goal? Only 20% of the reasons you are 
not achieving your goal are on the outside. 
Always start with yourself.

## 5. Identify the knowledge, information and skills you will need to achieve your goal.

a. Especially, identify the skills that you will have to develop to be in the top 10% of
your field.
b. Your weakest key skill sets the height of your income and your success.
i. Key Question: “What one skill, if you developed and did it in an excellent
fashion, would have the greatest positive impact on your life?” Whatever the
skill, write it down, make a plan and work on it every single day.

## 6. Identify the people whose help and cooperation you will require to achieve your goal.

Make a list of every person in your life that you will have to work with or work around to
achieve your goal.
a. Start with the members of your family, whose cooperation and support you will
require.
b. List your boss, coworkers and subordinates.
c. Especially, identify the customers whose support you will need to sell enough of your
product or service to make the kind of money that you want.
d. Once you have identified the key people whose help you will require, ask yourself
this question, “What’s in it for them?”
e. To achieve big goals you will have to have the help and support of lots of people.
f. The most successful people are those who build and maintain the largest networks of
other people whom they can help and who can help them in return.

## 7. Make a list of everything you will have to do to achieve your goal.

a. List every single step that you can think of that you will have to follow to ultimately
achieve your goal. 
b. As you think of new items, add them to your list until your list is complete.
c. When you make out a list of all the things you will need to do to achieve your goal,
you begin to see that this goal is far more attainable than you thought.

## 8. Organize your list into a plan.

a. You organize this list by arranging the steps that you have identified by sequence and
priority.
i. Sequence – what do you have to do before you do something else, and in
what order?
ii. Priority – what is more important and what is less important? The 80/20 Rule
says that 80% of your results will come from 20% of your activities.
b. The 20/80 Rule says that the first 20% of time that you spend planning your goal and
organizing your plan will be worth 80% of the time and effort required to achieve the
goal. Planning is very important.

## 9. Make a plan.

a. Organize your list into a series of steps from the beginning all the way through to the
completion of your goal. When you have a Goal and a Plan, you increase the
likelihood of achieving your goals by 10 times, by 1000%!
i. Plan each day, week and month in advance.
ii. Plan each month at the beginning of the month.
iii. Plan each week the weekend before.
iv. Plan each day the evening before.
b. The more careful and detailed you are when you plan your activities, the more you
will accomplish in less time. The rule is that each minute spent in planning saves 10
minutes in execution.

## 10. Select your number one, most important task for each day.

a. Set priorities on your list using the 80/20 Rule. Ask yourself this question: “If I could
only do one thing on this list, which one activity is most important?” Whatever you
answer to that question, put a number “1” next to that activity.
b. Then, ask yourself, “If I could only do one other task on this list, which one task would
be the most valuable use of my time?” Then write a number “2” next to that task.
c. Go on until you have seven topics.
d. Focus and Concentration are the keys to success.
i. Focus means that you know exactly what it is that you want to accomplish.
ii. Concentration requires that you dedicate yourself to doing only those things
that move you toward your goal.”

## 11. Develop the habit of self-discipline.

a. Once you have decided on your most important task, resolve to concentrate singlemindedly
on that one task until it is 100% complete.
b. Your ability to select your most important task and then to work on it single
mindedly, without diversion or distraction, will double and triple the quality and
quantity of your output and your productivity.
c. Single Handling is one of the most powerful of all time management techniques.

## 12. Practice visualization on your goals.

a. Create clear, vivid, exciting, emotional pictures of your goals as if they were already a
reality. Imagine yourself enjoying the accomplishment of this goal.
b. In visualizing, take a few moments to create the emotions that would accompany the
successful achievement of your goal.
c. A mental picture combined with an emotion has an enormous impact on your
subconscious and your superconscious mind.
i. This activates your superconscious mind. 
ii. Your superconscious mind activates the Law of Attraction and begins
attracting into your life people, circumstances, ideas and resources that will
help you to achieve your goals even faster.
