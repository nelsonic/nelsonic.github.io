# Answers to @dwyl Start-Here [Questions](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/89eefbd74ad94f8681faf0a65a576541a560a948/questions.md)

![disclaimer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/63130242-ae8b6b80-bfb1-11e9-848e-256f3020bb51.jpg)

Some of these answers are quite personal by definition.
My intention is to _capture_ my thoughts and be able to refer to them.
My intention is _not_ to offend or upset anyone.
I have _unintentionally_ offended some people in the past
with what I've written or said.
I learned a lot from those experiences.
If you are **_easily_ offended**,
**please** either **don't read** it,
***or*** if you insist on reading,
please _give_ me feedback
so that I can _understand_ ***exactly*** what you found unpleasant
and thus improve my emotional intelligence.


##¬†0. How did you discover @dwyl?

I discovered @dwyl when In√™s
[suggested it](https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues/28#issuecomment-96254680)
as a name for our App/company.
<br />

## 1. Why are you here?

I'm here because In√™s and I agreed to
join forces and work together on the App/Company
rather than working separately for other organisations.
<br />

##¬†2. Is there anywhere you would rather be or anything you would prefer to be doing right now?

No. I know that by focussing on building an App that I can use
to track my progress on my highest priority tasks/activities
and thereby maximize personal effectiveness and share it with others
I can achieve _anything_ in the future.
I see building this App as _foundational_ for all other success in life.
Without it my _whole life_ will be sub-optimal.
<br />

## 3. Is there a "significant person" (or people) in your life?

Yes, In√™s and now our Son! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I would love to spend more time with family (parents, siblings & cousins) and friends;
that will become easier once [@home](https://github.com/dwyl/home) is open. üè°
<br />

##¬†4. Who is the person (or list of people) that most encourages you to keep improving?

Myself. Unquestionably, I push myself to learn and do more.
Not to be disrespectful or be harsh to anyone else in my life/family,
but I've always been self-sufficient in terms of setting my own goals
and doing the work to achieve them.
My parents are "_laissez-faire_"
when it comes to the "achievements" of their children
and never pushed me to get good grades,
go to a "good" university or get a "good" job.
In a way that's _preferable_ to a
["**tiger parent**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting)
who _expects_ or _demands_ their child
to do _exactly_ what they have planned
(_or risk catastrophically **disappointing** everyone in the family..._).
In other ways, I really _wish_ my parents had encouraged
me to focus on specific areas of learning,
deliberate practice and achievement early on.
I've had to learn focus skills as an adult and it's been a struggle.
Again, not to be critical of my parents or other caregivers,
I just there had been more focus on developing specific skills/interests
rather than being "OK" at a lot of different things. 
<!-- I know for _sure_ that if I am ever blessed with having children,
I will be a _much_ stricter parent
with more structure and support systems
that will aid effectiveness. --> 

> **Note**: if you are surrounded by people
who appear to have no ambition
or are satisfied with their lives
and yet you feel an _urge_ to do more
and are _unsatisfied_ with where you are,
we _feel_ you!
<br />

## 5. Do you feel you have a personal "mission" in life?

Yes, to live the best life I can
while leaving the world better than I found it.
Right now I'm focussed on building
https://github.com/dwyl/home
which will be an open source blueprint for co-living
and innovation hub.
<!-- with integrated vertical aero/acquaponic farming. -->
<br />

##¬†6. If you could work on any challenge/problem, what would it be?

The **biggest challenge** humanity will face in the **next 20 years**
is **mass** technology-driven **disruption** of **employment** as we know it today.
AI/Robotics will replace at _least_ 20% of jobs; more like 40%!
That is on par with the unemployment of the 
["***great depression***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) 
of 1930's.
Without jobs people will not be able to afford to live.
We therefore need to work on both affordable housing
and sustainable food as our highest priority.
See: 
[Humans Need Not Apply](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/318)
and 
[AI is Coming ... ](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/733)
<br />

## 7. If you won the lottery, what would you spend your life/time doing?

I wrote this question to help people think about 
what they would do if money was no object.
If you had **`$10 Million`** in the bank; 
enough to have a 
["passive income"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp)
of **`$500K/year`** or **`$40K/month`** 
i.e: _never_ have to think about money again.

If I were in that position and had _not_ yet built the @dwyl App,
I would use the money to hire the best team and build the App _faster_. 

If the App was already built and sustainable,
I would use my new-found free time to move onto 
["phase two"](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two)
where I would buy a _large_ forest near 
a body of water (_the ocean or a large lake_)
and build the ultimate treehouse village;
think 
[Ewok Village](https://www.google.com/search?q=ewok+houses&tbm=isch) 
but with modern sanitation and climate control.
I'd make it a forrest school / summer camp / adventure park
where anyone could come to live in and connect with nature.


## 7.a Are you already doing any of the things you listed above?

I'm currently working on "Phase 1";
building the App that I need to manage/prioritize 
my ever-expanding todo list and communicate with my teammates
Without this foundational layer,
all other effort is suboptimal.

I would like to make building the App my _exclusive_ focus.
<br />


## 8. Do you believe the statement: "you only live once"?

100%. This is why I'm so _fixated_ on making the most of my life.
I was brought up in a God-fearing family
and have had exposure to all major religions
and several smaller ones.
I've read all the scriptures
(_as part of my University Ethics course_)
even if you don't believe in God,
the absence of _evidence_ for reincarnation 
means any _rational_ person 
_must_ conclude that 
[You Only Live Once](https://youtu.be/z5Otla5157c)
<br />


## 9. What is the most valuable lesson you have learned in life?

Not to waste any more time than strictly necessary on
["**Takers**"](https://youtu.be/YyXRYgjQXX0).
**1-way relationships** 
with people who have **no intention** of 
**_ever_ reciprocating** either with you 
or with **_anyone_ `else`**. 
They are in _life_ for themselves and that's it; 
their only interaction with society is 
"_what's in it for **me**_?". 
They _never_ ask themselves:
"_How can I **help someone `else`**
and **mutually beneficial**_?"

If you find yourself in the company 
of a person that just takes and never gives back 
(_to you or anyone else_),
then politely move on.
It's better to lose them as a "friend"
(_which they aren't really, they are just **using you**_!),
than to continue wasting your precious time.
Life is too short 
and you will only have heartache.
<br />

<!--
They have been brought up 
to _take_ whatever they can in every situation.
This is typical of people with a
["fixed mindset"](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/5-ways-to-go-from-a-scarcity-to-abundance-mindset.html).

I used to to believe these people 
would _eventually_ be grateful and 
["_pay it forward_"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward). 
But I've since had a rather rude awakening;
some people don't don't see _anything_ "wrong"
with themselves and therefore don't _want_ to change. 
They don't see a problem with always taking.
They think the world _owes_ them something
(_and in some cases **everything**_),
and they feel _cheated_ 
when they don't get _exactly_ what they want.

Learn how to distinguish "takers" _early_ 
and politely let them go.
Even if it's painful to "cut out" people from your life
you _must_ do it - the sooner the better - and move on!

If I could go back in time 
and tell my younger self
not to waste a single _second_ of time 
more than pleasantries on takers,
this would be the most valuable thing.

I've had to do this recently and it was
one of the most unpleasant experiences in my life.
I still _often_ find myself thinking about the person,
wishing there was something I could do
to help them change their mind.
They are intent on being
[entitled](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/entitled)
and I don't think anything will change their mind.

All I can do is work as hard as I can
to ensure that I surround myself with people
who _understand_ 
[social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm)
and 
[enlightened self-interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest)
-->

## 10. What was the most difficult decision or challenge you have faced?

Related to the previous question,
the most difficult decision I've had to make
was cutting someone I _really_ liked (_or thought I liked_)
out of my life.

But my new challenge is a _much_ more positive one that I relish every moment of;
being a parent. 
It's challenging because I'm still working full-time 
and haven't had much sleep in the last few months.
But it's something I'm _delighted_ about.
<br />

## 11. Have you ever _failed_ to take advantage of an amazing one-time opportunity?

Yes.
Not going into too much detail on this.
(_Happy to expand in person if you ask me..._)
But the gist this:
if someone makes you an offer,
try to understand the conditions
and long-term implications.
If it makes sense take it with both hands!
It helps to have a **journal**
where you write down your all thoughts
and refer back to them.
<br />


## 12. What have you made a conscious choice to say 'no' to even though it was a great opportunity; and why?

I've said no to recruiters from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.
By most people's definitions working for these companies would be a "dream job".
But the opportunity cost is too high.
I don't need more money, 
I need more _time_!

<!-- 
Saying no to Google was difficult
because I knew I would learn a lot 
and meet lots of great people.
But ultimately I was enjoying working at Groupon at the time
and didn't want to move.
Also I would have been working on their Ad Platform,
which, while not inherently "bad", 
is not very _interesting/creative/challenging_.

Saying no to Facebook (_multiple times_)
was _easy_ because they are ***fundamentally***
[***evil***](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-react/issues/23)
company that is systematically wasting 
billions of hours of people's time each day
and brainwashing people to click on ads.
I've written about this extensively elsewhere.

When I was 16 and thought Microsoft was "good" company,
I would have gladly accepted an offer to work there.
But I've since realized they are a 
[wolf in sheep's clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_in_sheep%27s_clothing).
MSFT were 
[evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2v4ses/why_is_microsoft_so_widely_considered_evil/)
in the 80's & 90's
and now they are _much_ worse!

Amazon is an amazing company from a _technical_ perspective.
I politely declined the invite 
because I wanted to focus on what I'm doing.
-->
<br />

## 13. Is there a person you used to be close to who you no longer speak to? Why?

Sadly, yes.
Growing up I learned to never 
[burn bridges](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/burn-your-boats-bridges)
so every friend I've ever had I'm still on good terms with
and every job I've ever left I could go back to and they would re-hire me.
I never thought I would have to "let go" of a person.
But it happened.
I'm not going to "name and shame" the person in `public`,
that's _obviously_ not how I function.
I hope this will never happen again.
But if it does I know what to do; 
write it all down immediately
so I can get it out of my head and _move on_!

> When I wrote this question in back in 2018
I never thought I would be answering this way. 


## 13.a What would cause you to "cut out" someone from your life?

Someone who lied to me, stole from me or disrespected me without remorse. 
The person I had to cut out of my life last year did all three.
As much as I wanted to help them, they: <br />
(a) didn't want to help themselves <br />
(b) wanted me to help them without any gratitude <br />
(c) claimed I was only helping them for my own gain <br />
I had *zero* to "gain" out of the relationship.
It was 100% one-way from beginning to end. 
They cost me *hundreds* of hours of my time.
I was trying to help this person who refused to study
and is _still_ working a dead-end shelf-stacking retail job.
I tried to help them learn a highly valuable skill 
so they could go from minimum wage to a _real_ money
without needing a degree or experience!

> Just ask _any_ of the people
I have given a recommendation on LinkedIn
who I have worked with (_and mentored_) in the past:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelsonic/
My 
[mission](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/6fac8f0e4b9a81cba929eb7e577f22a4a0eb734c/mission.md#what-is-dwyls-mission)
is to _help_ people
not to take advantage of them
for my own gain!

The person I had to cut out 
not only refused to make _any_ effort,
they _stole_ from me
and threw a tantrum when I brought it up. ü§Ø 

I can forgive almost anything and have.
I had a relative who got caught up taking drugs as a young adult.
They borrowed a chunk of cash from me 
claiming to have kicked the habit,
but had not. 
Obviously they _forgot_ about it,
and never paid me back.
They lied and stole from me.
2 years later I helped pay for their rehab
and they managed to get and stay "clean".
All was forgiven.
<br />

## 14. "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

> I got this question from Peter Thiel's Zero to One:
https://fs.blog/2015/11/the-single-best-interview-question-you-can-ask/

The way we manage and track what we do with our lives 
is fundamentally broken.
People are _wasting_ thousands of hours of their lives
on mindless entertainment 
because they don't have a system to keep them on-track.
I _desperately_ wan to "fix" this.

> Some people agree with me.
But the _vast_ majority don't
because they have been brainwashed
into thinking that watching TV/Netflix/etc.
or mindlessly scrolling through Facebook/Instagram
is what they _really_ want in life.
> Nobody on their death bed 
wishes they had spent more time watching TV.
