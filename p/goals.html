Personal Goals</h1>

  <p>
As the title suggests,
this post is <em>highly personal</em> (<em>to me</em>). &lt;br /&gt;
I have only made it <code class="inline">public</code> so that the people <em>in</em> my life &lt;br /&gt;
can be <em>aware</em> of my goals so they don’t get “<em>annoyed</em>“ &lt;br /&gt;
with me when I <strong><em>skip dinner</em></strong>
(<em>because I prefer to <strong>not eat after 18:00</strong></em>) &lt;br /&gt;
or <strong>refuse</strong> a <strong><em>sugary “food”</em></strong> (<em>junk</em>) because
I don’t want to “<em>relapse</em>“ into <strong><em>bad</em> habits</strong>. &lt;br /&gt;  </p>

  <p>
If you are <em>cynical</em> about people having life goals &lt;br /&gt;

<em>Why</em>?</h1>
<h3>
&gt; “If you <em>want</em> to live a <em>happy life</em>, tie it to a <em>goal</em>, <em>not</em> to <em>people or things</em>.” ~ Albert Einstein</h3>
<p>
<strong><em>Several</em> studies</strong> have concluded that
the <strong><em>single</em> most important <em>predictor</em></strong>
for our own <strong>long-term success</strong> in life
is setting <strong><em>personal</em> goals</strong>.
<strong>Only</strong> by having goals can we make the <em>most</em> of our lives
and <strong><em>minimise</em></strong> our <strong>regrets</strong> from <strong><em>wasted time</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
“<em><strong>Setting goals increases achievement</strong>. 
<strong>Hundreds</strong> of <strong>correlational</strong> and <strong>experimental studies</strong> show evidence 
that <strong>setting goals increase success rate</strong> in various settings.</em>“
~ Selen Turkay (2014). Setting Goals: Who, Why, How?
(<em>Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching</em>)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Think of a time when  you <em>wished</em>
you had <em>started</em> something <em>sooner</em>. &lt;br /&gt;
For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
learning a new skill,  </li>
  <li>
working on a project with a tight deadline,  </li>
  <li>
getting fit/strong  </li>
  <li>
saving/investing. &lt;br /&gt;  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In <em>most</em> things in life,
<em>starting earlier</em> leads to “<em>better</em>“ results, &lt;br /&gt;
and yet <em>most</em> people <em>procrastinate</em>
and <em>blame</em> their lack of progress on low “<em>motivation</em>“.</p>
<p>
<em>Most</em> (93% of) people don’t <em>realise</em>
that <strong>setting goals <em>creates</em></strong> the <strong><em>focus</em></strong>
which in turn <strong>drives <em>motivation</em></strong>. &lt;br /&gt;
<strong>Without</strong> the <strong><em>clear</em> goal</strong>,
<strong>motivation</strong> is virtually <strong>non-existent</strong>.</p>
<p>
Once we have <strong><em>clearly defined goals</em></strong>,
we need an <em>effortless</em> way of <em>tracking</em> if an activity is moving
us <strong>towards</strong> (<em>or <strong>away</strong> from</em>) our <em>specific</em> goal(s);
more about that later!</p>

What (Are <em>My</em> <em>Personal</em> Goals)?</h1>
<h3>
&gt; “_The ultimate reason for setting goals is to entice you to become the person it takes to achieve them_” ~ Jim Rohn</h3>
<p>
At the <em>start</em> of 2017 I <em>shared</em> my “<strong>Todo List</strong>“:
<a href="https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/40">https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two/issues/40</a> for the year. &lt;br /&gt;
While <em>several</em> things have been “<strong>checked off</strong>“ on the list,
I have made almost <em>zero</em> progress on a <em>number</em> of them
which makes me sad …
Rather than “<em>giving up</em>“ on myself and watching cartoons on Netflix,
I’m <em>attempting</em> to <strong><em>re-focus</em></strong> on my <strong>goals</strong> by making them “<strong><em>SMART</em></strong>“.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em><strong>Note</strong>: while there is <code class="inline">some</code> evidence
that sharing goals in <code class="inline">public</code> &lt;br /&gt;
can lead to <strong>not</strong> achieving them
(see: Derek Sivers TED Talk below), &lt;br /&gt;
I feel that if I <strong>don’t</strong> make the effort
to <strong>clearly communicate</strong> &lt;br /&gt;
my goals with the people in my life
who can <strong>help me</strong> achieve them &lt;br /&gt;
(e.g: my <a href="https://github.com/iteles"><strong>wonderful wife</strong></a> and other close relatives
who may be &lt;br /&gt;
expecting me to stay up late at “Dinner” or work colleagues &lt;br /&gt;
who may expect a reply
to an email after 20:00 at night…) &lt;br /&gt;
I am <strong>unlikely</strong> to <strong>succeed</strong>.</em>  </p>

<p>
In his 1943 paper “<em>A Theory of Human Motivation</em>“, Maslow’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">“hierarchy of needs”</a></p>
<br />
<p>
lists “Physiological”, “Safety”
and “Love/Belonging” (“social belonging”) &lt;br /&gt;
as the three most <strong><em>basic</em></strong> <em>foundational</em> “<strong><em>needs</em></strong>“:</p>

<p>
For <strong><em>many</em> people</strong> these <strong><em>basic</em> needs</strong> are <strong>not met</strong>
which is <em>outrageous</em> in a world with so much wealth! &lt;br /&gt;</p>
<p>
On more than one occasion I have been
both <em>homeless</em> and <em>unemployed</em>/“<em>broke</em>“.
I’ve had a a <em>tiny taste</em> of how soul-destroying it is
to <em>not</em> have a place to call “<em>home</em>“
and can <em>empathise</em> with how <em>not</em> having the “basics”
makes achieving virtually <em>any</em> other goal <em>impossible</em>.
When there’s no food in your belly
it’s not easy to <em>think</em> about anything <em>else</em>.</p>
<p>
For the 4 years I was at University Inês and I volunteered for Oxfam’s <em>trading</em>
division to help market FairTrade goods which we believe are <em>part</em>
of the solution to empowering people to meet their own basic human needs.
I still <em>fully</em> intend to resume the effort to help the <em>most</em> disadvantaged
people in the world with <em>self-empowerment</em>, however, I intend to do my part,
using technology; (<em>see: section 4 below</em>).
<strong><em>Only</em></strong> by making <em>everything</em> we do <strong><em>100% Open Source</em></strong> can we be
a <em>part</em> of the <strong><em>solution</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
<em>This</em> post is <em>not</em> the place to discuss “<em>wealth re-distribution</em>“
through universal basic income,
and how it will <em>directly</em> benefit the <em>richest</em> members of society
just as much as the least blessed,
however I/we do have an <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> (<em>collective</em>) <strong>goal</strong> of helping
<em>everyone</em> achieve the most basic needs.
see: <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two">github.com/dwyl/<strong>phase-two</strong></a></p>
<p>
<em>Thankfully</em>, today I have a home where I am “warm, dry and safe”. &lt;br /&gt;
I am <em>blessed</em> to have access to fresh/clean water
and (<em>no shortage</em>) of food! (<em>see “Nutrition” section below</em>)</p>
<p>
Therefore I consider the <strong><em>first three</em></strong> “<em>levels</em>“
of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to be “<em>achieved</em>“ for me <em>personally</em>.
For that “<em>solid base</em>“ I am <em>constantly</em> and <strong><em>eternally</em> grateful</strong>.</p>

<em>Tiredness</em> inhibits <em>all</em> other progress towards <em>any</em> (<em>of my</em>) goals! &lt;br /&gt;
I need to get <em>plenty</em> of rest by getting an <em>early</em> night.</p>
<p>
When I am tired I often loose sight of my goals
and <code class="inline">default</code> to <em>negative behaviour</em>
like eating sugary/processed foods to prop up my energy levels.</p>

“<em>If I’m feeling tired, <strong>sleep</strong>!</em>“  </li>

  <li>
First “<em>meal</em>“ of the day should be an ultra-nutritious green smoothie
or soup. see: recipes!  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Avoid</strong> all <strong>processed/packaged</strong> foods where I do not know/control
the ingredients (sugar/salt), additives and flavour enhancers. including:    <ol>
      <li>
Breakfast cereals (<em>high in added refined sugar!</em>)      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong><em>Eliminate</em></strong> “<em>Empty Calories</em>“; no sugary drinks of any kind!  </li>
  <li>
Don’t <em>Buy</em> Ice-Cream as it has as much <a href="http://www.benjerry.com/flavors/chocolate-fudge-brownie-ice-cream">sugar</a> as Coca-Cola! (<em>the cheaper the Ice-Cream the worse the ingredients; logical but worth repeating!</em>)  </li>

<strong><em>don’t buy</em></strong> any <em>packaged</em> foods (<em>they <strong>all contain sugar</strong>!!</em>)    </li>

<p>
I <em>cannot</em> think of a <em>healthy</em> food that contains <em>refined sugar</em>. Can <em>you</em>? &lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, <em>several</em> people have studied the effects of sugar
on the brain and overall health and the <em>evidence</em> is <em>conclusive</em>:</p>
<p>
Sugar is “<em>as addictive</em>“ as <em>cocaine</em>:</p>

Therefore I <em>must</em> conclude that it has no place in my <em>healthy</em> life.</p>
<p>
Does that mean I <em>cannot</em> eat a slice of “<em>wedding cake</em>“? &lt;br /&gt;
No, it just means I don’t <em>buy</em> any products with refined sugar. &lt;br /&gt;
i.e. I don’t spend my own money on damaging my own health. &lt;br /&gt;

1.3.2 Sample Morning Exercise Routine <em>Revisited</em></h3>
<p>
After a few months of doing my morning bodyweight exercise routine
I defined (<em>above</em>),
I can <em>easily</em> do the two sets of push-ups and plank;
which I consider the most “<em>taxing</em>“ exercises.
I feel that I should be doing more with legs
because legs are “half my body”,
and (<em>according to my “DEXA” scan</em>)
where roughly 40% of my “fat” is.
So I need to turn up the “heat” and get the blood pumping to my legs!</p>
<p>
I have thought about (<em>and researched!</em>) the <em>effectiveness</em> of “Leg Abductors”,
and concluded that they aren’t <em>effective</em> for my <em>current</em> goals: fat burning.
So I’ve decided to replace them.</p>
<p>
My “revised routine” is both <em>simplified</em> and <em>slightly</em> extended.
Rather than doing 5 minutes (<em>which I now find quite “easy”</em>)
I’m <em>calculating</em> how long I need to exercise for based on how many “sets”
I want to do of <code class="inline">each</code> exercise.</p>
<p>
Whereas <em><code class="inline">before</code></em> I was doing <strong>6</strong> different exercises,
now I will be doing <strong><em>5</em></strong>:</p>
<h4>
Pushups</h4>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/35187597-534742e0-fe1e-11e7-9263-059fd05a89ec.gif" alt="pushups" />
</p>
<h4>
Bridges</h4>

<h4>
Plank</h4>

</p>
<h4>
Squats</h4>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/35187591-3900b416-fe1e-11e7-8779-80d7c31912e2.gif" alt="squats" />
</p>
<h4>
Lunges</h4>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/36350306-5873c776-148e-11e8-8427-227002877eb7.gif" alt="lunges" />
</p>
<h4>
How Many?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
5 exercises x <strong>3 sets</strong> each = <strong>15 sets*</strong>  </li>
  <li>
15 sets x 20 seconds (per set) = 300 seconds
(<em>still “only” <strong>5 minutes</strong> of actual exercise!</em>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the original routine, there was a rest period after each exercise. &lt;br /&gt;
<em>From <strong>experience</strong></em>,
I don’t <em>need</em> a “rest period” between certain exercises
e.g: between pushups and plank and squats to lunges.
So I’m cutting certain “rests” to <strong><em>increase</em> intensity</strong>!
Instead I am placing the rest time where I <em>need</em> it,
which is mostly during “<em>transitions</em>“ from floor-based exercises
to <em>standing</em> ones e.g: from a “Bridge” to “Squats”.</p>
<p>
There are <em>still</em> <strong>8</strong> rest periods in my routine,
these are <em>realistic</em> and allow me to catch my breath.</p>
<h4>
<em>Revised</em> Bodyweight Exercise Routine</h4>
<h4>
Set 1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
00:00 - 00:30 <strong>Push-ups</strong> (<em>fewer good reps is better, hold at top!</em>)  </li>
  <li>
00:30 - 01:00 <strong>Plank</strong> (<em>go straight into plank without rest</em>)  </li>
  <li>
01:00 - 01:10 “Rest” (<em><strong>prepare</strong> for bridge exercise; start ASAP!</em>)  </li>
  <li>
01:10 - 01:30 <strong>Bridge</strong> (“Lying Hip Raises”)  </li>
  <li>
01:30 - 01:40 “Rest” (<em><strong>prepare</strong> for lunges by standing up to rest…</em>)  </li>
  <li>

There is <em>conclusive</em> evidence of the link between oral health
and overall body health.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
There is “<em>a strong link between the effects of chronic oral inflammation
and general health. The mouth is the visible gateway to the rest
of the body and reflects what is happening deep inside.
Over 100 systemic diseases that have oral manifestations,
such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, respiratory infections,
pancreatic cancer, diabetes, and nutritional problems.</em>“ &lt;br /&gt;

2. Family/Loved Ones</h1>
<h3>
&gt; “<em><strong>No one</strong> ever said on their <strong>deathbed</strong>: ‘Gee, I <strong>wish</strong> I had <strong>spent more time alone</strong> with my <strong>computer</strong>‘.</em>“ ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Bunten_Berry">Danielle Berry</a></h3>
<p>
I am <em>guilty</em> of pouring <strong><em>way</em> too much</strong> of my time into my computer,
and not anywhere <em>near</em> as much in my relationships.
<em>Trust</em> me, I would <em>much</em> rather win the lottery,
never have to work again and spend all my time with family!
(<em>more on that in section 4 below.</em>)</p>
<p>
The reason <em>family</em> is <em>second</em> after health</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Make/Spend more time with family in <em>person</em>.  </li>
  <li>
Figure out how to track the <em>quality</em> of time spent with family.  </li>
  <li>
Take <strong><em>more photos</em></strong> with family.  </li>
</ul>
<h1>
3. Communication</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong><em>SMART</em> Goal</strong>(s):  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
<strong>Invest</strong> (<em>at least</em>) one “pomodoro” <strong>writing</strong> <code class="inline">each</code> <strong>morning</strong>.    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<br />
<h3>
&gt; “<em>The single <strong>biggest problem</strong> in <strong>communication</strong> is the <strong>illusion</strong> that it <strong>has taken place</strong></em>.” ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a></h3>
<p>
One of the areas of my life
where I am <em>especially</em> “<em>underachieving</em>“ is <strong><em>communication</em></strong>.
At <em>least</em> once per <del>day</del> <em>hour</em> I feel <em>frustrated</em> because
I feel someone has <em>misunderstood</em> what I have said or written, &lt;br /&gt;
<strong><em>or</em></strong> because <em>someone</em> has not given sufficient instruction/clarity
in a request that they have made.</p>
<p>
Poor communication is the <em>single</em> biggest time-waster in
an organisation and the biggest cause of relationship breakdown in families.</p>
<h3>
&gt; “<em>It’s dreadful what <strong>little things lead</strong> people to <strong>misunderstand</strong> each other.</em>“ ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Maud_Montgomery">Lucy Montgomery</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Avoid all “<em>arguments</em>“ as they are simply misunderstanding
due to poor communication. Instead <em>immediately <strong>write down</strong></em>
the source of the misunderstanding (<em>in notebook</em>) as a topic
that requires clarification then <em>write</em> out your point of view
when you have more time (<em>and a clear head</em>!)  </li>
  <li>
Share my thoughts on a given topic on a <em>daily</em> basis.  </li>
  <li>
Invite others to respond (<em>comments</em>) to foster dialog.  </li>
  <li>
Call Mom, Dad &amp; Gran regularly. (<em>see: evening routine above</em>)  </li>
</ul>
<h1>
4. Income &amp; Expenditure</h1>
<p>
<em>Most</em> of my goals in the first 3 sections
are <em>achievable</em> with <em>minimal</em> income.
<em>However</em>, in order to “<em>unlock</em>“ the “Top Level” of Maslow’s Hierarchy,
I’m going to need very <em>specific</em> amounts of <em>cashflow</em>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Make “<em>enough</em>“ money to cover all living expenses.  </li>
  <li>
Track all expenses to ensure that I know where the money is <em>going</em>.  </li>
  <li>
Determine how much <em>cash</em> I need to invest in my <strong>projects</strong> (<em>see: section 4, above</em>)  </li>
</ol>
<h1>
5. (<em>Self</em>) <em>Actualisation</em></h1>
<p>
Returning to the nomenclature derived by Maslow (<em>see: “0” section above</em>)</p>
<h2>
5.1 Code</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Write code</strong> for one of our projects <strong><em>every</em> day</strong>.
(<em>opening an <strong>issue</strong> on GitHub with an idea or link is <strong>not enough</strong>
to <strong>exercise</strong> my coding “muscles”</em>)  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
The <em>reason</em> coding is <em>first</em> is because I <em>firmly</em> believe
software is the <em>best</em> way way to “<em>leverage</em>“ my time to
the benefit of most people.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
5.2 Physical Things</h2>
<p>
<code class="inline">make</code> <em>useful</em> things that solve real human problems.</p>
<p>
I will be <em>building</em> the following projects in the order they are required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Worlds’s most comfortable Bunk Bed  </li>
  <li>
Wheelchair accessible Sofa-bed (<em>with linear actuators</em>)  </li>
  <li>
Ergonomic Sit-Stand Desk … people who need to work at a desk
(<em>e.g: because they use a monitor.</em>) or those who realise that using
a “<strong>Laptop</strong>“ <strong>on</strong> your <em>lap</em> for prolonged periods, <em>destroys</em> posture!  </li>
  <li>
Aquaponic/Aeroponic Food Growing Tower
for fresh greens with <strong><em>Zero “Food Miles”</em></strong>  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
5.3 Plants</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
Study natural sciences  </li>
  <li>
Plant food-bearing Plant  </li>
  <li>
Learn which are the best “<em>companion plants</em>“ for each food plant.  </li>
  <li>
Track as many variables as feasible.  </li>

spend the rest of your natural life waking up and going after it.</em>“ &lt;br /&gt;
“<em>You better <strong>stop making excuses</strong> and <strong>find a way to win</strong>.</em>“
“<em>You need to tell you: no more TV, no more snacks, no more deserts, no more,
we’re working out now.</em>“ &lt;br /&gt;
“<em>You need to tell you that you owe you something</em>.”
“<em>Cause I owe it to myself, and can’t <strong>nobody stop me but me</strong>.</em>“</p>

“&lt;br /&gt;
<em>Most of you <strong>say</strong> you <strong>want</strong> to <strong>be successful</strong></em>, &lt;br /&gt;
<em>but you <strong>don’t want it bad</strong>, you just <strong>kinda want it</strong></em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>you don’t want it <strong>badder</strong> than you <strong>wanna party</strong></em>, &lt;br/&gt;
<em>you don’t want it as much as you <strong>want to be cool</strong></em>, &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>Most</strong> of you <strong>don’t want success</strong></em>
<em>as much as <strong>you want</strong> to <strong>sleep</strong></em>! &lt;br /&gt;
<em>Some of you want sleep more than you want success.</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>I’m here to tell you again,</em>
<em>if you’re going <strong>to be successful</strong></em>, &lt;br /&gt;
<em>you gotta be <strong>willing to give up sleep</strong></em> … &lt;br /&gt;
<em>If you <strong>really want</strong> to be successful, some days,</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>you’re <strong>going to have to stay up three days in a row</strong>.</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>because if you <strong>go to sleep</strong>,</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>you might <strong>miss the opportunity</strong></em>
<em>to be successful</em>.&lt;br /&gt;
<em>That’s how bad you gotta want it.</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>Listen to me, you gotta want to be successful,</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>so bad that you <strong>forget to eat</strong></em>. &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>Beyonce</strong> said once she was on the set, doing her thing,</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>three days</strong> had gone by, she forgot, she <strong>didn’t eat</strong>.</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>cause she was <strong>engaged</strong></em>. &lt;br /&gt;
<em>I never forget: when 50cent was doing his movie,</em>
<em>I did a little research on 50</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>and 50 said when he wasn’t doing the movie</em>
<em>he was doing the soundtrack</em>. &lt;br /&gt;
<em>and they said: ‘when do you <strong>sleep</strong> 50…?</em>‘ &lt;br /&gt;
<em>‘sleep?’ he says, ‘sleep?!’</em> …
<em>“sleep is for those people who are <strong>broke</strong>, I don’t sleep!”</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>“I got an <strong>opportunity</strong> to <strong>make</strong> a <strong>dream</strong> become a <strong>reality</strong>“</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>Don’t</strong> try to <strong>quit</strong>, you’re <strong>already in pain</strong>, <strong>get a reward</strong> from it</em>! &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>Don’t</strong> got to <strong>sleep until you succeed</strong>.</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em><strong>Listen to me</strong>, I’m here to tell you today, that you can come here</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>you can jump up, you can do flips</em>,
<em>you can be excited when we give away money,</em> &lt;br /&gt;
<em>but listen to me, you will <strong>never be successful</strong> until,</em>  &lt;br /&gt;
<em>I don’t have to give you a <strong>dime</strong> to do what you do</em>. &lt;br /&gt;
<em>You won’t be successful until you say: “<strong>I don’t need that money</strong>“</em>. &lt;br /&gt;

While I <strong><em>wholeheartedly</em> agree</strong> with Eric Thomas’ “<em>gotta want it bad</em>“
speech and I’ve <em>been</em> there not sacrificing sleep for (<em>short term</em>) success,
I think it’s worth noting that he doesn’t say you “<em>must not sleep</em>“,
rather he’s saying you must be “<strong><em>willing to give up sleep</em></strong>“,
i.e. you must be <strong><em>willing</em></strong> to <strong><em>get up</em></strong> in the morning,
even when you still feel tired and want to “<em>snooze</em>“.
I suspect that on stage when he’s delivering a “<em>motivational speech</em>“,
he doesn’t really have that much time to go into the
“<em>benefits of a <strong>sustainable routine</strong></em>“ … he’s just trying to illustrate
to people that those who are successful
wanted what they got more than <em>anything</em> else.
If <em>you</em> want to be successful <em>long-term</em>, i.e. without “<em>burn out</em>“,
<em>trust, me</em> you <strong><em>need sleep</em></strong>. But you <em>must</em> “<em>sleep smart</em>“.
Learn how to improve the <em>quality</em> of your sleep so you wake up refreshed
and <em>ready</em> for another day of <em>focus</em>.</p>

“<em>Constantly think: If I had <strong>no limitations</strong>, <strong>what goals</strong> would I set for myself?</em>“</p>

If your life was <em>perfect</em> in the “four key areas” of life:
Income, Family, Health &amp; Net Worth …</p>
<p>
“<em>The <strong>fear</strong> of <strong>not achieving</strong> your goal, what we call self-limiting beliefs, <strong>holds you back more than anything else</strong>.</em>“</p>

“<em>The most important responsibility you have
is <strong>setting</strong> goals in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;
Goal <strong>achieving</strong> seems to be <strong>automatic</strong>,
it’s the goal <strong>setting</strong> you are responsible for.</em>“</p>

number two: you can try to figure it out on your own,
with no proven system or strategy to guide you
which is the <strong>primary reason</strong> why people underachieve and <strong>fail</strong>
or <strong>number three</strong>: you can put my <strong>30 years</strong> of research knowledge and

Keep Your Goals to Yourself (Derek Sivers): <a href="https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4">https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4</a></h4>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/NHopJHSlVo4">  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30483747-e88eed34-9a1f-11e7-9618-8e7b132d8fa9.png" alt="keep your goals to yoursef" />
</a></p>
<p>
Derek Sivers shares the good <em>theory</em> “<strong><em>Social Reality</em></strong>“
which states that if you <em>communicate</em> your goals with others,
your mind lets <em>you believe</em> they have <em>already</em> been  <em>achieved</em>
and therefore you are less likely to make the effort
required to <em>actually</em> achieve it.</p>
<p>
Even though there is <em>some</em> scientific <em>evidence</em> to support the theory,
I <strong><em>don’t agree</em></strong> with this <strong><em>at all</em></strong>.
If you don’t <em>share</em> your goals with anyone  <br />
a) Nobody will <em>understand</em> <strong><em>why</em></strong> (or <em>what</em>)
you are trying to achieve/change/improve  <br />
b) You will have <strong>no help/support</strong> to keep you “on
track” towards your goal.  <br />
c) You will <strong>not</strong> find <strong><em>like-minded people</em></strong> to <em>accelerate</em> your goals!</p>
<p>
Think about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_Watchers"><strong><em>WeightWatchers</em></strong></a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank"><strong>Grameen Bank</strong></a>
model of group-accountability:
in both the weight loss and micro-loans <em>everyone</em> in the group
knows each other’s fitness and financial goals, respectively,
and both are highly successful (and <em>widely copied</em>) models.</p>
<p>
Another perfect/plentiful example of people sharing their goals
is Kickstarter where people share their idea/goal -
<em>complete strangers</em> fund them - and the whole thing works
precisely <em>because</em> people <em>follow through</em> with their announced
goals/plans (i.e. <em>deliver</em> what they promise).</p>
<p>
You fail to achieve your goal, because you don’t <a href="http://youtu.be/mgmVOuLgFB0?t=2m14s">“<strong><em>want it bad</em></strong>“</a></p>
<p>

</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Also, I <em>know</em> I’m not meant to “<em>criticize</em>“ people for their appearance,
but I find it <em>difficult</em> to trust someone talking about achieving goals
who is overweight …
<em><strong>nobody</strong> has “<strong>belly fat</strong>“ on their list of <strong>goals</strong></em>!”  </p>

To Achieve Your Goals, Don’t Focus on Them (Reggie Rivers): <a href="https://youtu.be/V2PP3p4_4R8">https://youtu.be/V2PP3p4_4R8</a></h4>
<p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/30485975-047d69ba-9a27-11e7-91d0-4795697121e0.png" alt="dont focus on your goals" />
</p>
<p>
This is an <em>interesting</em> video where Reggie Rivers re-iterates the point
made earlier by Brian Tracy: don’t focus on your goals.
The <em>downside</em> of the video is that Rivers does not give any
practical instruction on “<em>how to set goals</em>“ in the <em>first</em> place.</p>
