# Should I Learn Erlang or Stick to Node.js ?

## Intro

Erlang first came on my radar while reading [7L7W][]: http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X which sadly only dedicated *38 pages* to Erlang which was *barely* enough  to scratch the surface and didn't *build* anything useful.

My First impressions of erlang were: this is *terse* and *unfriendly* to beginners. :anguished:

Ever since then I've been *plagued* by the thought of Erlang being "better" 
than Node.js for "high scalability".

The fact that Facebook and WhatsApp are both using Erlang for their 
massive-concurrency high-availability real-time (#buzzwordfest) chat apps
tells us they have *done* the research into the available platforms for writing chat...

And then a while back @Tony called my attention to [Elixir][] 
and it lured me back into doubt... Elixir looks *elegant* and ticks many boxes.
