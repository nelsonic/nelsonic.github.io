# Should I Learn Erlang or Stick to Node.js ?

Erlang first came on my radar while reading 7L7W: http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X which sadly only scratched the surface and didn't *build* anything useful.

My First impressions of erlang were: this is terse and unfriendly to beginners. :anguished:

Ever since then I've been *plagued* by the thought of Erlang being "better" 
than Node.js for "high scalability".
