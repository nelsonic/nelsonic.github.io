Estimating is one of the most _difficult_ things to do in _any_ creative endeavour.
People are **_famously_ bad** at estimating effort 
_especially_ for an activity which they have **not _previously_ performed**, 
or where there is **_any_ level** of ***uncertainty**.

The ***reason*** we estimate in ***time*** (_Minutes/Hours_) @dwyl instead of "**_Effort_ Points**" is _because_ ***everyone understands time*** whereas **many _non-technical_ stakeholders _cannot_ reason about a logarithmic "point" scale** where 4 points is not _double_ the effort of 2 but rather an order of _magnitude_ greater "perceived complexity"... Needless to say that we feel a points-based system is arbitrary and does not help with effective communication, estimation or schedule planning. 

We _agree_ that using time-based estimates _firmly_ puts the _responsibility_ for those estimates
on the development team and this _can_ be "_stressful_" at least initially because inexperienced technical people will (_almost by definition of their inexperience_) be _woefully_ ill-equipped to estimate the amount of time to perform a task/activity which they have (_highly likely_) never undertaken before...

So why do it "**The Hard Way**"?
Anything worth doing is _never_ easy. 

By practicing estimating in time we _all_ get better at:
+ thinking through the story/task and 
  + requesting clarification or further detail if the story description is unclear
  + breaking it down if it feels "too big" to be done in one day.
+ focusing our efforts
